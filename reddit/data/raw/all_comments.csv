lvquex7,t3_1gl0ty4,"The world is not going to end.

America as a democracy is slowly crumbling before our eyes, but the world will go on.

The Good:

1. We democratically elected a President. There was no violence (although if the Dems had won, Trump was certainly going to incite more violence). Historically speaking, people get the elected leaders they deserve.

The Bad:

1. Competent Government: There is no question that Kamala would have presided over a competent Federal government. She had sound policies (which btw were incredibly centrist) that are supported by a majority of Americans. Trump will install political hacks and sycophants in all levels of government. How do I know, check schedule F. We are in for bureaucratic nightmares.
2. Economy. The US economy by all measures is the best of the developed world since COVID, by a long shot. Stock market indices are good, inflation has cooled, unemployment is at its lowest sustained levels in years, ,manufacturing jobs roared back under Biden. So essentially Biden took a shitty economy (which BTW was not all of Trump's fault, but he does share quite a bit of blame, his taxation policies have continued the hollowing out of the middle class by transferring the tax burden from the super rich down to lower economic brackets) and landed it perfectly (with help from the Federal Reserve). Trump's policies will have some pretty negative long-term consequences for the U.S. When they say tax cuts, everyone making under $360,000 will see their taxes increase, only those making over $360,000 will see a decrease in their taxes.
3. Environment. Regulations designed to protect human health and welfare will be eroded. When you get pancreatic cancer from PFOA/PFAS I hope you buy a MAGA branded colostomy bag from Team Trump.
4. Education. They are going to continue to devalue education, expect the quality of education in this country to decline.
5. Health Care: We already have a health care system that is in shambles. No western country pays more for health care and has worse outcomes. If you really want to understand why I would highly suggest reading ""America's Bitter Pill"" by Stephen Brill.

The Ugly

1. Hate. America embraced hate like it has never embraced hate before. First election of Trump, yeah, I'll give you a pass for electing him, but second go round, you know exactly who you voted for and why. Don't kid yourself, there have been white nationalist movements in this country going all the way back to the Know-nothings, but MAGA is that on on JP-5. It is cruelty to those that are the most vulnerable amongst us, people of color, immigrants, the marginalized. Those people will lose the most. A President that called large swaths of American citizens ""the enemy"" and turned American's against each other is now going to be there for the next four years.
2. Constitutional Government. Americans elected a President that has continually shown is willing to break the law and ignore the Constitution, the Guardrails are off. The adults that were in the room that recognized the importance of the constitution are gone. All bets are off, we have Full Monty Trump and it is going to be day-after-day constitutional ass-wiping for the next four years. He is who is is, and he will do what he says is going to do, he has also packed the court with ideologues that have skewed versions of the Constitution and the limits of executive authority.
3. Russia. The biggest winner in all of this. While MAGA was popping corks and DEMS were in tears nobody noticed that Russia actively attacked our election. They attacked in the lead-up and they attacked it on election day. This happened and really it should be the lead story. It is also hugely problematic that Twitter (X) is also being used as a propaganda tool for the Russian government. When Musk had shortfalls to purchase, he relied on outside investors including some Middle Eastern and Russian, to front the money. With Musk's contacts with Putin, this is incredibly problematic. I find it interesting that the MAGA crowd, who is virulently anti-communist, is okay with Musk's cozying up to communist and a Presidential candidate that has had multiple off-the-record conversations with Putin. I am not saying that Musk or Trump committed treason, but they are sailing perilously close to the fucking wind here.

There is much more but this is the sad truth. The national media is also to blame here, but probably not for the reason's you think (especially MAGA). We live in a nation that has fully embraced fear and ignorance, we will reap what we sow. Americans are asking the wrong questions. Do we want to live in a country in which the richest control access to the truth? Do we want an economy that destroys the middle class? Do we want to continue to degrade the environment?",58,2024-11-06 14:23:27,Silent-Law-4883,0,True

So when Trump fires all non-partisan career professionals in government, replaces them with radical loyalists within every nook and cranny of the US government, and adds radical judges everywhere.

When the cancer you caused has infected every bit of the American system and it can’t be unwound for a lifetime.

What then?

Do you beg this country for forgiveness for choosing fascism because you were conned into believing your eggs are too expensive because of Joe Biden?

You just put Steve Bannon in charge of American policy. 

You just put Michael Flynn in charge of our military. 

You just put Alex Jones in charge of media and propaganda. 

You just put Stephen Miller in charge of immigration policy. 

You just put batshit crazy RFK Jr. in charge of health policy. 

You just killed free public education and privatized schools, which you will have to pay for. 

You just sealed the deal on a national abortion ban, because you’re demented if you think it’s not coming. 

You just radicalized the Supreme Court for a generation.

You just made women less safe and less free. 

You just made this country an oligarchy with the billionaires quite literally in charge now.

1) He would have lost in 2016 had the Democrats got behind Bernie Sanders and not Hillary Clinton. They should have realized that she is radioactive.

2) Biden was the right candidate at the right time during the pandemic but he was not who we needed to fight Trump and he should have bowed out earlier. Kamala was a good candidate but the issue the Democrats have had since 2000, with every candidate except Obama is charisma. None of the candidates appealed to both men and women both like Obama did. Unfortunately, Trump was able to get enough conservative Christian women to vote for him and more men wanted to vote for him than Kamala.

The country is going to be in the totally wrong direction, and if the GOP doesnt manage to rig future elections well likely have a blue wave in mid terms, but as the fallout from MAGA comes about the democrats will likely be blamed, the country will swing right again, and Im afraid no meaningful progression is ever going to happen because its just a pattern that repeats.

(And who cares if they accidentally sweep up Americans in the process, right?) You wanted an all white country, well now you're gonna get it.

So you want the Christian religion force taught in public schools? Ok, here's to hoping that you ""Christians"" get everything you asked for! May your kids of other faiths get hammered and indoctrinated in the schools with a religion that is not yours.

I think that Trump should just go ahead and start targeting Americans who didn’t fully embrace him, let's start with putting people like Cheney and Milley on trial, hell, it will be entertaining to watch on TV, right?

I hope he withdraws from NATO and all that comes with that happens, even if a war gets started and other western alliances decide to withdraw support for us, right? I will fully embrace those high tariffs, go ahead, let's do it. I have my new computer, my TV isn't that old and my car is just fine. Your on your own though! You Americans wanted this. So I don't want to hear ANY bitching from these folks when shit comes down around their heads.

Here's to hoping if we have another serious pandemic that Trump handles it the same way he did the last time he was in office.

All that student debt you Americans were getting from Biden, here's to hoping Trump stops all that. You want changes to disability, Medicare and Social Security? Here's to hoping Trump privatizes it and slashes your monthly income in half and kicks you disabled folks off your disability because ""Trumps people think you should be working"", (because you don't look or seem like you are disabled!)

Here's to hoping the ACA gets neutered or dismantled if not repealed, and you all get to go back to your skimpy health plans that don't cover anything! Here's to hoping that Trump undo's the medication price negotiations and your insulin goes back up to a 1k a month again! Shoot, lets start putting medical debt back on that credit report right?

I hope he crushes unions too! You union members who voted for him are going to get all you asked for! Here's to hoping Trump tramples on your working rights!

I hope he gets rid of the FDA and the USDA (hell let them 10 year old's work in those factories again!), I hope he dismantles the CDC and public education.

Because of my career and industry, I’m actually expected to do quite well over the next 2-4 years. Yet somehow I don’t feel good about that. I believe in pursuing my own self interest, but not at the cost of the social fabric of our country. 

I feel guilty saying this, but I want a recession to hit us. I want groceries to be prohibitively expensive for most people. I want tariffs to make purchases difficult.

lvrh0vo,t3_1gl0ty4,"I think it's time for Democrats to focus on their own mistakes instead. And judging from all the comments here, this doesn't seem to be the case. At least not here on Reddit.

This wasn't just a win, this was a blowout. A clear message that Democrats should not ignore. 

They are clearly losing touch with the voters. Ironically, that includes minorities as well. As someone who agrees with Democrats on more than a few policies, throughout the election, I found it impossible to communicate with them. 

The moment you even begin to question something, you are bombarded with insults, name calling, doomsday scenarios... You're either 100% on their side, or you're their enemy. That elitist, cocky approach made it very difficult to side with them. 

You may not realize it; but from a neutral standpoint, you were the ones looking like a cult. Getting all volatile when someone's just trying to have a conversation with you, understand your side of the argument.

This is not doing you any favors. Creating an echo chamber and attack everyone who isn't in line is the worst thing you can do to yourselves. This is a good way to lose voters who could potentially be on your side.

For example I was anti-abortion about 5 years ago. It took a single, very sensible woman to change my mind on it completely. She didn't say ""you're a man so shut up"", like many others did. She actually explained her side and logic, which made me see through a perspective I was not able to before.

This is how you can get to people, get your message across. Not by trying to shut everyone up who doesn't say the things you want them to say. An aggressive approach is only going to make the others think you are not of an healthy mind and drive them to side against you.

Democrats certainly have many good points on many different issues. The problem is the way you choose to deliver your message. Be patient, be open minded. Know that we all are coming from different backgrounds and had different life experiences.

He will tariff the world (US consumers) filling Americas coffers and suck every drop of oil from the ground while fitting in a new record number of games of golf as the women he promised to protect 'whether they like it or not' die of pregnancy complications in states that also end up banning contraception and IVF.

2) He is friends with the leaders of North Korea and Russia - this is a tragedy for Ukraine and the world. 
3) Tarrifs will increase prices/ inflation will be insane.
4) Tax cuts for the wealthy and business, not you and I.
5) This country was founded on immigration- YOU are here because your family (1-4 generations ago) immigrated.  Our poor friends we have been helping from the Ukraine will probably be deported in 2025.  They lost their home from the war, and not only will have to flee to a war torn country that will now be destroyed, but the 40+ year old father will be forced into enlisting in the war. Ukraine and other countries will fall.
6) Know anyone looking to get pregnant on purpose or on accident?  If they have medical complications and the pregnancy has to be terminated, it will be against the law and they could die.
7) He will end the Paris agreement to help stop global warming.  Rising ocean waters, higher temps, more hurricanes……
8 ) He will once again try (and hopefully fail) to eliminate marketplace health insurance (obamacare), which will force early retired Americans (like me) back into the workforce to seek insurance. No job, healthcare will be unattainable financially and preexisting conditions will once again be a thing.

lvrahft,t3_1gl0ty4,"I think this is the first time voting in 16 years that I’ve been on the losing side.

I honestly thought it would be a defining election. Turns out it was, just not the way I had thought.

I always vote which candidate has the policies that I care most about, never paying attention to the R or D in front of the name.

Going into the election I really thought the overturning of Roe would completely sink the Republican Party across the board for at least the next 8 years. Because even if it doesn’t affect me directly the thought of having a daughter, sister, or friend who has the option of choice taken from them in some cases regardless of circumstance was frankly horrendous. 

Hind sight, economy was always going to decide this election and it was always going to go republican. While I’ve been fortunate enough to be fine, even great over the past 8 years I didn’t care about the immediate and shifted my focus to the future. For the majority of Americans though they don’t get that benefit it’s hard to think 8, 12, 16 years down the road when you have a giant pile of bills blocking the view.

While I personally think the democrat parties policies will help most/all of us long term, I can also see how the republicans promise to help today, right now is just so tempting to anyone struggling. 

Now I get that even that last statement can and will be argued from both sides, but above facts and above the truth is frankly optics. People struggling today want help now, they don’t want to hear about how paying off student loan debt helps everyone, how helping Ukraine is good for the free world, or how 100s of other policies will help make a better future. They want someone to tell them I hear you want help, I will put you first and I don’t care what that means for tomorrow, or across the ocean.

This election came down to one party promising a brighter future for everybody, and the other party promising to help you today. You can argue if you don’t believe either one, you can argue racist, misogyny, bad candidate, or whatever you want, doesn’t matter. The majority of Americans voted for who they think will help them personally right now and while 1 party focused on the future the other focused on today.

While I may disagree with the thought process that got this result and what will actually happen. I can also acknowledge the immediate economy wasn’t even in my top 3 concerns for this election, if it was I may have listened to the messaging, and actions far more differently.",3,2024-11-06 15:36:06,SnooGoats8949,0,True

Now to be clear, deporting illegal citizens is not a new thing but what makes this so bad is 80% of those immigrants have lived, worked and contributed in the usa for over 10 years. If you know anyone who is an illegal immigrant (chances are you do, even if you dont know it), consider them gone.

And now abortion. Donald trump has stated that he will not be out right banning abortion on a federal level. However Donald trump and JD Vance will be pushing to reinstate the Comstock act of 1873. This law makes it illegal to mail or post any form of abortion related drug, equipment etc. This will force hospitals to not give abortions as they simply won't have access to the resources needed. So let me ask you this, how would you feel if your 10 year old daughter was brutally rated and forced to give birth? I hate to have to use such an extreme example, but unfortunately that is the reality for many parents and children.

There has also been a lot of talk about how trans rights will be affected by this. In Donald trumps previous term he tried to instate a law which banned transgender people from entering the military, showing us he has a direct discrimination (among many) to transgenders. And now many believe this discrimination will come into play once again with fears over certain essential drugs and equipment being banned.

So no, people shouldn't just ""calm down"", there in fact is many reasons to be worried about his presidency. Also is everyone excited for his immunity from the law, and the 10% tariff tax that will end up passed onto the end consumer? Can't wait!

Hopefully by then the democrats pulled their head out of their asses and finally learned how to listen to their constituents and we landslide the midterms.

That needs to be the focus - kicking these criminal sycophants out at the next opportunity. Hopefully that will lead to blocking everything Trump and his ilk hadn’t accomplished and we can get a sane, rational president back in office come 2028.

This is of course assuming the country hasn’t fallen into a barren hellscape and our international allies have turned their backs on us as Trump lets Kim and Putin play puppet master with the US.",3,2024-11-06 19:13:04,BioDriver,0,True

lvswn12,t3_1gl0ty4,"I just want to point out something to a lot of people that might not understand this. While this is the beginning of the next presidency, it is also the end of this storyline. The Republican Party is at a crossroads with itself and it splintering down the middle. One side you have moderate Republican who wants to move the country in a direction of conversation with Democrats and the other side you have the radical Republicans. The party is going to cannibalize itself. 

As for the people that voted for the Republican Nominee, I want to point out a little thing that you might not have thought about. While you are all for deporting migrants, we need to remember that the economy will not stay afloat without those individuals. 1) Migrants make up only 18.6% of the labor jobs in this country. That is not a number that is hurting our workforce. 2) Migrant jobs include working on farms and construction sites as well as mines, factories, food preparation, cleaning, and child care. Here is where Republicans made their mistake.

If the deportation of migrants happens, the farms, construction sites, factories, mines, food preparation companies, etc. will have few things that will occur:

1) **Getting rid the migrant workers will eventually cause these companies to close.** Why? These companies will be getting rid of their work force that is paid off the books. These companies have bult in paying migrants off the books that they would not be able to handle paying the same amount of people on the books. Result: Companies crash, farms in the Red States no longer function, prices of goods produced by the company skyrocket, people can't/won't buy their goods because they are too expensive, local economies crash, the Red States cannot function.

2)  **The companies keep the workers but have to provide them with Green Card Status.** Why? They do not want to get rid of their labor but now they have to pay them a livable wage. Result: Green Card Status increases, the migrants become citizens, which means they vote, Red States will see shifts to Blue. 

So what does that mean? Well, Republicans who felt that voting for the Republican Nominee would lower grocery costs, it won't. It will cause them to increase. Coupled with tariffs, getting rid of the CHIPS and Science Act, you're looking at being a lot worse off than you were the last four years.

So where does this go? The next four years will be an embarrassment, but Republicans will not be voted in as President for a long time after this. No one will be able to inherit the Republican Nominees cult because they have not been able to yet. The Red States population will decline because they will be moving to Blue States to feel protected. This is the end of the Republican Party.",3,2024-11-06 20:06:06,whelpthatslife,0,True

A leader who had time and time again said ominous things, things a good person wont even say.     


I wonder how the people of the world will view us now, how will they view us, when we, one who defends freedom in the world, start becoming friends with those who want to remove the freedom others, when we who supports others fight for their freedom, suddenly stop, when we who are part of an alliance of countries who wish to defend freedom, become one who won't care about others freedom.    


Remember that it was us, the people, who put him there, to what we will now call a throne, for his actions and words shows his want for a throne, for he himself said that we no longer need to vote, added with his Project 2025 revealing many chilling things, he will be king and there is none that can be done about it.        


I am one who has no side, I am one who votes for whom I want, as a leader and as a person, whether that leader be republican or democrat matters not, for its only a side, what matters is what kind of leader will we be under, how will he be as he leads, and from his action alone, my want for him to lead me dwindled, added with his words it was gone, and from what i've seen as both waved their flags, I think i'm better off with the girl.

Look up foundations of geopolitics on Wikipedia

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics

The West In the Americas, United States, and Canada: Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States and Canada to fuel instability and separatism against neoliberal globalist Western hegemony, such as, for instance, provoke “Afro-American racists” (today it’s white supremacist and any extremists) to create severe backlash against the rotten political state of affairs in the current present-day system of the United States and Canada. Russia should “introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social, and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics”.[9]

I would like to add to this list: the politics more than the people.

Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett’s business partner, once remarked, “If you show me the incentive, I will show you the outcome.” Our society is largely run by software, and the incentives behind social media algorithms do not align with the principles that strengthen democracy. Instead, they prioritize maximizing engagement and capturing attention. 

For the last 15 years, we’ve effectively run an A/B test on democracy, leading to a society that has become addicted, distracted, and polarized, all while lacking the necessary training in critical thinking, and education to step back. Social media unintentionally built an endless supply of divisive content as a feature. It is jet fuel, exacerbating our natural tendency to form into tribes or camps and Trump is the candle that will take advantage of this weakness. It’s not surprising that we could elect a fascist today.

The American Democracy experiment has essentially ended. We're not moving into full blown fascism and all attempts to push Russia toward being the #1 superpower of the world.

TECHNICALLY we're still waiting on the House results but if that goes to a Republican majority we are well and truly fucked. Even if it doesn't Trump has shown every intention of abusing Presidential executive orders to unknown absurdity and he has the Senate and Supreme Court to let him do it, not to mention he will likely be able to further solidify complete control over the Supreme Court and frankly all courts across the country.

It is technically possible that the mid-term election in 2 years helps limit the destruction to only the next 2 years but Republicans and Project 2025 have every intention of making sure there are no fair elections ever again and they never have a chance of losing power at all in any way.

Currently the best potential outcome that I can possibly see is Democrats retaining the House and fighting like hell to prevent quite literally everything the republicans try to do AND Trump not surviving the next 4 years one way or the other (including being removed from office due to his mental condition by his own party) which could lead to fracturing of the MAGA base of supporters and lead to infighting among the party that somehow changes the results of the next elections.",2,2024-11-06 15:45:30,c14rk0,0,True

We would review with others to essentially point out flaws in initial arguments, fix bad mistakes in the writing, etc.. 

Afterwards the prof would take ‘em and do the same. 

Being the *great* student I was I totally forgot about it. I had did some initial research previously but never wrote the paper. I banged out the minimum required 5 pages in the 30 minutes before class. 5 minutes of that was spent walking from my dorm to the class and another 5 was spent trying to get my god forsaken HP printer to work. 

As we’re passing them around I was honest saying to people, “I’m sorry it’s pretty rough. I wrote it 20 minutes ago. 🤣.” 

Then I read some of my classmates’ papers and was astounded with how horrible they were. I couldn’t even describe to you how bad they were. The arguments, research, and just general cohesiveness for every one was non-existent. They were riddled with fragments, misspellings(how does spell check fail you that much), typos, and more! One guy was like “you spent 20 minutes on this!? I spent hours!” 

When we received the papers back from the prof, there were minimal changes I needed to make while most others’ papers I looked at had to basically do complete rewrites.

If you live in a small, mostly white, christian, town; if your news mostly comes from right wing sources; if your social circle consists of people pretty much like you; if you, in other words, live a rural or exurban life there's an excellent chance that you don't know anyone who's gay, or trans, or black, or muslim, or an immigrant.

And times have been hard for a lot of those folks.  Real wages are up but they're not going up near as fast in small towns and rural communities.  Those folks are getting left behind.  They're angry about it.  They have a right to be angry about it.

And Trump says he's going to do something to fix that. Now, if you have some college level economics or if you read a for-real newspaper every morning you can probably tell that the specific things he's talking about doing are nonsense.  But Harris really couldn't acknowledge those issues at all.  She had to run on ""the economy is doing pretty good.""  

Harris made a compelling case for why a vote for her protected LGBTQ folks, religious minorities, and especially women but if two out of those three categories are largely theoretical to you, it's hard to muster a lot of empathy and willingness to sacrifice on brass-tacks issues that matter to you and your family in order to take care of them.

And as for abortion... we already know that most anti-abortion folks just assume that they and their loved ones will never need one.  It's just a lot easier to imagine that abortion is used as a first-line of elective birth control than it is to think hard about the moral complexities that go into every abortion decision.

And yes, I'm aware that the person I'm describing here isn't a terribly empathetic one; they are a small person living in a small world.  But they're not _evil_.  They're not irredeemably bad.  They can be reached.

You think this is a 'gotcha' but it's not. If you think gender and race do not influence people's decisions you live in a happy fantasy land where the last several centuries of racism, and the last several millennia of sexism either do not exist or have had no repercussions on society.

I'm not saying it's sexist or racist to not vote for a woman or a black person over a man. I'm saying there is a clear subset of people, especially young men, who are unwilling to vote for someone who's not a straight white man, regardless of leanings. There are genuinely people who think women are too 'emotional' to vote, and possess similarly petty beliefs that influence their voting habits. That, for example, Latinos swung right after Trump had a guy shit on Puerto Rico and has a VP who accused immigrants of eating pets, what other reason would they vote for him other than machismo? What other reason would Muslim men vote for him despite his clear, rampantly pro-Israel stance? What other reason would black men vote for him despite how he treated the Central Park Five?

lvu0kvd,t1_lvr1mbx,">Why would you blame the people for having values, and not the parties for supporting and funding genocide?

We can criticize politicians and political parties for their actions, for sure, but we can also criticize voters for their choices (especially when they lead to negative outcomes that seemed obvious in advance).

And when people act in ways that directly contradict the values they claim to hold, it's worth pointing it out (so people can learn from it in the future, if nothing else).

For example, some people say their #1 issue is pro-Gaza/anti-Israel stance, but either voted for Trump, or chose not to vote to stop him (e.g. 3rd party or non-voting).  They have the right to make that choice, but it doesn't align with or advance their supposed ""values"", since Trump is by far the more pro-Israel candidate (remember, Trump accuses the Democrats of being anti-Israel, and literally called Biden and Schumer ""Palestinians"" as an insult).

Here's a few examples from an article about a watch party of Arab Americans in Dearborn, Michigan: [https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20241106-dearborn-somber-watch-party-arab-americans-turn-backs-harris-open-door-trump](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20241106-dearborn-somber-watch-party-arab-americans-turn-backs-harris-open-door-trump)

No, Elprede007 didn’t answer u/Ok-Scheme9347's question in the way that was asked. While Elprede007 initially acknowledged they’d be happy if Trump succeeded, they didn’t fully engage with the hypothetical scenario without adding caveats or critiques.


Instead of focusing solely on the imagined benefits of Trump’s potential successes, Elprede007 introduced criticisms of Trump’s economic policies, highlighted issues with the pandemic response, and voiced doubts about his leadership style. They also added personal concerns about other potential policy decisions (like RFK Jr. in public health) and even turned the question back on u/Ok-Scheme9347 by asking if they could admit Trump might not perform well.


In short, Elprede007 responded with a blend of hypothetical acknowledgment and real-world skepticism. This approach didn’t strictly follow u/Ok-Scheme9347's condition of imagining the scenario without “buts” or counterarguments. u/Ok-Scheme9347 was looking for a response that simply explored the hypothetical positives without critique, which Elprede007 did not fully provide.


My response: Look all I am saying is if we exclude the unnatural event of COVID year of trump and even Biden's 4 years, Trump's first 3 years were really good for everyone, simply put. 


What I mean is that the next 4 years are going to be same, people may call it he inherited it or whatever, but my fair judgement is that he would simply replicate those years as well. 




He won't have any bad economy, unless there is other unnatural event like covid. 


Riddle me this, would Trump's 4th year  still be not booming if there was no COVID?






My concern is that he should get the VOTER ID thing implemented, fair elections where people who are out of touch dont fall to echo chamber, this has been proven again for reddit and many celebrities fans and also how unfortunate that we are still short of 15-20M votes compared to 2020.

No, Elprede007 didn’t stick to u/Ok-Scheme9347's request. Instead of imagining Trump’s success as specified, they provided a critique of Trump’s past policies and gave reasons why they believed Biden’s policies were better. This response went against u/Ok-Scheme9347's condition of assuming positive outcomes without critique.


My response: You are super naive about the border situation, come on 10,000 people crossing border everyday, unvetted criminals, these same people straining cities and killing people. How is that good handling of situation? No wonder democrats were thinking of making them citizens and swing the states. Thank God Elon and his team and poll watchers were vigilant and helped safeguard the voting process. Trump's dumbest mistake was not implementing voter ID, he should do it now. 




Handling of economy by Biden was worst at best. Its an open thing now that democrats treat america as a business machine purely capitalistic. 


If the most ambitious, smart, intelligent guy can pull this thing off and put america on right track, glory days wouldn't be out days. This would be good all for us. Who really wants to live in a economy where corporations hijacks housing, no jobs, food high etc, so many immigrants creating low trust society that wouldn't be a country it would be jungle out there. America is too big and people have their community but more and more demographics changes would piush the best interest out. 


Most European countries are experiencing that and no wonder they are all out on those immigrants. 




There is nothing wrong to be in self interest of your country.

""The Trump who will walk into the White House on Jan. 20 is a man steeped in [unsettled vendettas](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/06/trump-retribution-enemy-list-00187725), who came within a hair’s breadth of a string of federal felony convictions that he is [now empowered to wipe away](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-election-criminal-cases-presidency-2024-11) with a self-pardon — as if those offenses and so many others had never even happened. Trump will see his priorities as he has always seen them: party over country and self over all. 

A man with [34 felony convictions](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/30/g-s1-1848/trump-hush-money-trial-34-counts) can’t win the presidency in a nation where trust in institutions is high. It’s only in a culture where the justice system has long since lost its legitimacy that a man with such a thick criminal record as Trump glides by relatively unremarked. That one man can so effortlessly game American institutions to his own benefit says as much about the decrepit state of America’s institutions as it does about the moral decrepitude of the crook.  

The nine years of the Trump era have taken a bat to our democracy, and Trump’s MAGA movement has exploited the nation’s systemic weakness at every turn. 



Trump is now set to return to the White House, and he’s made no secret of his lofty goals for a second term: [gutting the civil service](https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2022/07/trump-reelected-aides-plan-purge-civil-service/374842/), destroying the [independence of the Justice Department](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/02/trump-justice-department-officials-loyalists-lawyers-00186914) and seeking political and legal revenge on his lengthy list of [personal enemies](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/11/donald-trump-media-lawsuit-cbs/).

Since SCOTUS handed him full presidential immunity, there is no way to use the judiciary to protect against extreme policy. He has threatened to take away the licensing for any news agency that is unfriendly.  He has threatened to jail any and all political opponents. The early results of this can be seen with the pre-compliance of Jeff Bezos refusing to allow Washington Post adds for VP Kamala or any op ed’s supporting her to be published. 

The lower and middle classes are already footing the bill for his tax cuts to billionaires, he has promised to go further with this. He has promised tariffs up to 20% on any countries that do not comply, which the lower and middle classes will bear the cost of, not only in money but employment etc. 

There is little chance of an outright civil war. The country isn’t as divided based on region as it was the last go round. Because of gerrymandering most states are republican red with tiny islands of democrat blue- usually focused around city centers. The few blue states that exist are very blue, but are tiny. I expect a more likely scenario would be mass deportation followed by interring any Trump dissenters.  I imagine it will be likely that eventually people will start disappearing.

Their civilian internment camps consisted of camps dedicated to forced labour, medical experiments (much like those carried out by Josef Rudolf Mengele), there are documented accounts from both sides of commanders of these camps literally starving the interned populations by feeding them barely 400calories / day. Allied internment camps however were a different story, with the populations being allowed to build farms, schools, churches and basically function as a micro society, yes there were a few issue such as when a bunch of interned persons rioted and got rear gassed and one guy did get shot for walking to close to the fence, but they were the exception as opposed to the rule, all in all the camps were humanely run and there’s plenty of stories out there of the people in the camps becoming friendly with the guards and sharing food etc with them.

One of the issues was that people who have been in the country a long time (say, 10 years or more?) have family, ties, jobs, etc. and it would be cruel to deport them. But the Republicans especially balked at giving amnesty and possibly citizenship to illegal migrants.  So it never got fixed.  (This would simplify things like removing under the table hiring, being able to collect taxes, social security payments, etc.) After decades, the problem is worse. 

Plus, the people hiring illegals for their businesses tend to be the rich type who donate to Republicans. They like people who won't raise a fuss about things like proper wages or overtime rules.

So this problem has just grown over the years and by doing nothing, governments have encouraged even more to arrive. (Nothing new, same is happening in Europe from Africa across the Mediterranean).  They have also cheaped out on refugee adjudication, so it now takes over 5 years per case, the courts are so backlogged. 

Under treaties, America owes an obligation to refugees who are at risk of direct persecution personally from their givernment due to ethnic, religious, or political reasons. It does NOT owe a resident permit anyone whose life sucks in their home country, nor the right to come to the USA, skip immigration lines and qualification criteria.

It is because Republicans do not believe in healthcare for women or democracy. Abortion rights is about both. In countries where women lose their right to abortion those nations also become authoritarian. Authoritarian nations do not believe in rights. Especially in rights for women.

What would you tell me if I told that all of those so-called 'culture wars' that you are blaming Democrats for came from Republicans in 1980 with Reagan? Because that's exactly what happened.

>Until 1980, during any Presidential election for which reliable data exist and in which there had been a gender gap, the gap had run one way: more women than men voted for the Republican candidate. That changed when Reagan became the G.O.P. nominee; more women than men supported Carter, by eight percentage points. Since then, the gender gap has never favored a G.O.P. Presidential candidate.

>In the Reagan era, Republican strategists believed that, in trading women for men, they’d got the better end of the deal. As the Republican consultant Susan Bryant pointed out, Democrats “do so badly among men that the fact that we don’t do quite as well among women becomes irrelevant.” And that’s more or less where it lies.

>The entrance of women into politics on terms that are, fundamentally and constitutionally, unequal to men’s has produced a politics of interminable division, infused with misplaced and dreadful moralism. Republicans can’t win women; when they win, they win without them, by winning with men.

lvqz9ty,t1_lvqebxa,"I think ""admin bloat = high costs"" is somewhat of a false narrative. 

I picked an average university - Marist College - and used ChatGPT to tell me what the *average* person pays for everything (because remember, sticker price isn't what the average person pays). It said this:

> On average, students receiving grants or scholarships have a net price of about $39,364 per year. The net price can differ significantly depending on family income:
> 
> * Family Income Below $30,000: Average net price is $24,780
> * $30,001–$48,000: Average net price is $29,650
> * $48,001–$75,000: Average net price is $33,311
> * $75,001–$110,000: Average net price is $36,118
> * Above $110,000: Average net price is $41,602

Let's go with the top bucket, $42k. 

That includes room & board - so what does it cost to feed and house a person for a year? Most colleges charge in the $12-15k range for ""room and board"", so let's go with $12k, even though that seems a bit low.

That leaves $30k for ""tuition"".

Have you looked at the cost of tuition for private high schools? Most are above $30k and are closer to $50k. There is a religious high school in my region, the teachers don't have great qualifications, overall it is a bit better than average, and it costs around $14k/year. 

So given all that, is $30k/year in tuition at Marist too high? How much could that be trimmed by eliminating ""administrative bloat""? A couple thousand per student? Would people then say ""yeah, $27k/year is now affordable""? Especially when you add in the $12k room/board? 

What if tuition could be $14k? That would mean the cost to attend - with room and board - would be $28k per year. Is that now ""affordable""? 

If not, then what does ""affordable"" even mean? It seems like just a point used to rail against education.",1,2024-11-06 14:45:14,MoonBatsRule,4,False

Think something like removing the Electoral College and switching to Mixed-Member Proportional representation or ranked ballots, where you can democratically express a preference for more than one candidate or have multiple elected candidates to fairly represent equally divided regions, rather than the winner-takes-all First Past The Post system, which actively leads to two party mindsets since you can only back one candidate and one candidate wins 100% of the representation for the riding regardless of how many votes their opposition got.

For another example of the flaws of FPTP leading to a two party system, see Canada. Despite prominent third parties like NDP, Reform, BQ, and Green existing, FPTP in federal elections has led to either the Liberals or Conservatives winning every election since the nation’s founding. The best way for third parties to gain power is for them to merge with the two major parties, like how the Reform Party and the Progressive Conservatives merged into the modern Conservative party so they weren’t splitting eachother’s votes, or to form coalitions with one of the major parties and temporarily support them until the next election, like the NDP and Liberals tend to do.",-1,2024-11-06 15:51:36,Toberos_Chasalor,4,False

Shit has not been so sweet the last 4 year. He won the popular vote. Notoriously blue states were nearly swung and in play. This blinders and mental gymnastics Democrats are doing is crazy. We skipped the process an implemented a shitty candiate, ran a shitty candidate with no platform. Outside of reproductive rights can anyone tell me what Kamala was running on? I don't even follow trump but I could tell you his polices cause reddit spews them to the top every day as the perfect billboard for him. His plans for the economy and immigration and jobs and all this shit. And all we get from the Democrats is like a well he's bad and their dumb and that'll never work. But dumb people don't care if it works. They just wanted to hear he had a plan for basic shit that effects everyone like fucking groceries. Simple ass groceries. They operate on confidence. Thats all they needed to hear. That it was possinle to fix that. ""Muh semblance of plan"" at least theres somehting resembling a plan cause the democrats had nothing to run on. Its silly we can not admit that there were issues as pressing and as important as womens Healthcare that we just ignored entirely. 


Even when you look at from a perspective of women in red states married to conservatives men. The women still in those marriages as much as you wanna beleive there forced into this shit. They do it by choice.  We've been doing the trump thing for over a decade and for sure a lot of the women are just apathetic to it all and just go along but like a lot of those women actually support him. We are well passed that point. The orginal trump election. Covid. Four years of bullshit post trump. Those women sticking around in those states with those men, they don't think they need saving. And telling them they do and did probably was a mistake. Practically bullied this women by telling em they were stupid for who they love and where they live. You ostracized huge groups of voters that would support you with a better plan. Trump fear mongers for sure but what the fuck was kamala and co doing with these ""he won't find out"" ads that's just sowing fear as well. So there's the whole issue of hypocrisy there as well. And again these people aren't dumb despite living in these states.

On a issue they thought would carry more weight in red states. It's a complete disasters of a campaign and candidacy. Trump sucks but the democrats fumbled the bag big time.  We have no one to blame besides ourselves.

They are paid into by younger generations to support the older generations that are no longer working. They also rely on there being vastly more young than old, as that is what keeps the cost for the young manageable.

By the time I hit that age the demographics will likely be such that the amount of benefit I see is minuscule, as our population will likely stagnate over the next several decades. This means I will have paid into a system my entire life that I will not see a benefit from. 

I would be fine with a better system, but as it is right now I would rather see the old face the consequences of their actions by losing their social safety net. They have spent their entire lives being coddled and helped by the government, and now are spending the entire rest of their lives pulling the ladder up behind them. I do not want to continue to support people who continually harm me and my peers, and this is an effective means to drive home that message. 

I have spent what little time I’ve had as a participant in our democracy advocating for the betterment of the common people’s station in life. Equal rights, better public education, better pay for the working class, better social programs for everyone, etc. are all things I have tried to support, and are all things that the elderly vote against repeatedly despite the fact that they benefited from those things their entire lives.

It is very fucking complex as I try to figure this out myself but I absolutely hate it to resort to malevolence. 

Established Democratic parties are regularly involved in mass protests against the rise of right wing extremism, which often lead to violent escalations and clashes with authorities.

I think the undeniable axiom is that a prevailing sentiment exists and there is not much you can do to change that. So instead of attacking the supporters, one should identify the essence of the sentiment and strategically harness it to their benefit.

E.g. if the sentiment under an increasingly growing group of people is that they do not really feel a strong affinity for migrants, maybe instead of calling them racist, guard the fucking borders instead.

What else is a representative of the people supposed to do?

Because I believe that altering current border policies to align with prevailing sentiment is far more achievable than mending a society torn by polarization because no-one dares to listen to each other.

ETA: if it's not clear, I am trying to say that not voting is not how you get the DNC to pay attention to you. The way to get the democratic party to give a shit about your issues is to reliably vote, in every election, in some kind of bloc/ organized coalition. Start local. Grow that coalition. Talk to your reps regularly. Attract more people. Encourage them to turn out. Register people. Help them get to polls. Vote in primaries. Parties don't care about individuals they care about blocs. Specifically, they care about blocs that reliably and regularly turn their gripes into real votes.

Non nuclear proliferation is done, the entire point was that America would guarantee your security so you can rest easy and not have to increase the risk of world ending mistakes with nukes. Now the best way forward with where America is headed is for everyone to have their own nukes to ensure their own safety because trump thinks America is the world's police for fun (and somehow doesn't have benefits that far outweigh the monetary cost).

As a bonus, it also makes people more likely to distrust experts who may publicise conclusions based on verifiable facts that are inconvenient for the story said political leaders are currently pushing.

Would it make them more likely to vote a particular way? Maybe.

Perhaps I’m wrong and maybe they aren’t communists. The thing is, I support Trump. I think he was a great president and he will be a great president again. The problem isn’t that people dislike Trump and like Kamala (or either one).

The problem is that people make Trump out to be a villain, or a fascist. Some even say he is a modern day Hitler. That is just incredibly offensive to the people who was alive during those times. You can say he’s an idiot, you can say he’s annoying, he shouts too much, whatever; but he’s not some evil fascist who wants to build a dictatorship. The guy is pushing 80, come on…

He really does just care about the country. He could be out here living life retired with his family and a ton of money, but he chooses to still fight for this country. He is a dedicated man, he is respected by the world, especially by Russia, North Korea, and China (which is very important), and he says what he wants to say, straight to the point, no sugar coating. That’s why I like him. It’s a breath of fresh air with all the robot politicians. He isn’t perfect, but I like him, and that’s why I support him.

I have never heard anyone make any points like I have made, talking about their support for Kamala. Anyone I speak to who voted for Kamala did not actually vote because they supported her or her values or her beliefs or really anything about her. Everyone I speak to only voted for her because she isn’t Trump. I mean, okay, I guess.

Its easy to blame Trumpers and yea its gross. But Trump won because Dems let him. Dems failed. But Dem politics in the modern landscape is built on victimhood, so its far easier to go 'Fuck Maga' instead of looking inwards.  Look at the number of dems who campaigned NOT voting for her because of Gaza.  Or her record as a prosecutor.

Its INCREDIBLY short sighted and in no way based in any form of reality to think everyone will agree on everything.  Thats a fundamental issue within the left.  You dont see people on the Trump side of even being worthy of pursuit. You ostracize them, speak down to them, neglect their feelings on literally any issue because theres one on your checklist they disagree with you on, and outright dismiss them while hurling insults at them and criticizing them for doing the same thing (im not referencing you in particular, but a general mentality thats not hard to find).  Hell, im a progressice who has been on the receiving end of it MERELY FOR EXISTING IN THE SOUTHERN US.


The end result is a massive divide wherein youre simply expecting to out number someone to win. Thats not foresight and creates an incredibly volatile situation, which means long term change is unlikely.  Dem voters are pompous, which is why 3 million less people voted for Trump and he still won by 12 million.  


'The Youth' is irrelevant. People on the left are incapable of forming alliances based on overarching similarities because of a singular difference and the mass amount of judgement they then dish out because of it.  Dems will completely write off a potential ally because of ONE issue, even though having that one ally means both their issues get addressed.

The claim that it’s racist is just ignoring all of the issues that come with open borders. The fact that there’s no vetting, the liberal belief that we owe it to the rest of the world to let everyone in (we don’t, it’s our country), and ignoring how much illegal immigration has effected the economy since Biden took over. The housing crisis is a direct result of the massive influx of immigrants that are taking up all the housing. If we have a town of 50k people and there’s enough housing to provide for those individuals, then we decide to bring in 25k immigrants because whoever wants to come gets in. Now we have a town that has the capacity to house 50k people and we have 75k people who live there. That drives demand up and prices up astronomically. But no it’s just racism lmfao. That’s the most ridiculous rhetoric and that exact argument is why Trump was elected. People are sick of democrats covering their ears and yelling lalala instead of actually acknowledging that maybe unfiltered unvetted mass immigration is not a good idea.

He won the popular vote.

And before school, I’d definitely say that parents should be enthused to teach their children. And they don’t seem to be. They seem more upset about what is being taught, rather than educating at home as well. 

But even before that, I’d argue, where do those parents get energy when they are struggling, paycheck to paycheck? 

To me it seems that, in addition to what you’re saying, no one is enthused to educate kids at home before they go to preK and continue. It seems many people expect *only* the teachers to teach. But it’s not just parenting, parents need to do, it’s also continuous education for their kids and themselves. 

I remember my parents forcing me to complete summer reading lists, my mom made me read so many books from the library as a kid and we lived in the projects as well as were homeless. I mean my mom was a prostitute at points. 

If libraries were a new invention at this day, it would be turned down quickly. With how stringent people want to make education? We either want the teachers teaching (which includes discipline) or we don’t. Teachers can’t teach if they don’t discipline. 

Kids aren’t born with knowledge. “Forcing” them to learn isn’t abuse, and I really think some parents believe not giving kids an option to like certain things is abuse. Something that is for the betterment of your child is not abuse. 

This was not directed at you, this was only an addition. I really believe it’s a wrap around issue. 

A child’s first teacher is always their parents. But also, people like myself, are included in teaching children. Knowledge is power. I don’t have kids but i’m constantly around kids. Being a role model is an example of teaching on a daily basis for anyone to a child.

Going to depend heavily on the teacher and how far into the standardized curriculum era they're in.

As for the cheating in college these days... seems like it happens all the time. Sites like Chegg have all the standardized curriculum on them, quizzes, tests, final exams, etc. You can pay a tutor to just do your homework on some sites. Taking a big risk though because I think professors can get user account lists or something (I know two people from my MSDS cohort were caught). They also have some ways to prevent it. A few of my grad classes forced us to use a lockdown browser with a webcam on for all tests.

Also I don't really disagree with you - I think the deck is hugely stacked and income inequality and the 1% is by far the biggest problem our country and the world faces.

I'm just trying to play the heel here since that's evidently what all the poor people voting MAGA want.

But also I don't agree it's impossible in 2024 if you don't have wealthy parents. Even as a millennial back in 2012, my peers weren't making the best decisions to set themselves up for success and I doubt it's changed a lot now.

People want to think you can go to college, get a degree, land a job, buy a house, etc. If you're poor it doesn't work that way and it never has, even when I was getting started.

You need to go to college. You need to pick a major that has high career upside and low risk. Then you need to network. Then you need to get an internership, ideally sophomore or junior year. Then you need to network more at that internship. You need to study and do work outside of class to further build your real world knowledge and experience in your field, not just rely on what you're learning in school.

You need to leverage the internship, networking, and experience into a good job. Continue networking and learning, then after 3 years leverage that job into another job. Rinse and repeat.

If your family is rich then you start already having the connections and resources to cut out a huge part of the work required. You don't even have to be really competent.

So no, it's not fair. But it's still just as possible now, but people want to think they just do what's ""required"" and land a successful life. It doesn't work that way and hasn't for a long time.",3,2024-11-06 14:37:18,pragmaticzach,5,False

lvscvjc,t1_lvs9rce,"> When people are voting against their own interests, you have a very bad image problem.

Most people vote Republican because the Republican party upholds the patriarchy. Republicans win with men voters.

>Until 1980, during any Presidential election for which reliable data exist and in which there had been a gender gap, the gap had run one way: more women than men voted for the Republican candidate. That changed when Reagan became the G.O.P. nominee; more women than men supported Carter, by eight percentage points. Since then, the gender gap has never favored a G.O.P. Presidential candidate.

>In the Reagan era, Republican strategists believed that, in trading women for men, they’d got the better end of the deal. As the Republican consultant Susan Bryant pointed out, Democrats “do so badly among men that the fact that we don’t do quite as well among women becomes irrelevant.” And that’s more or less where it lies.

>The entrance of women into politics on terms that are, fundamentally and constitutionally, unequal to men’s has produced a politics of interminable division, infused with misplaced and dreadful moralism. Republicans can’t win women; when they win, they win without them, by winning with men.

>https://srpubliclibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/02/JillLepore.pdf

Also

>As has been observed of many oppressive institutions, the delegitimization of women’s authority isn’t the unfortunate side-effect of a broken framework. It’s the grease that makes the entire system go. Women’s erasure is an essential part of the deal powerful men have always made with the men they would have power over: let me have control over you, and in turn I will ensure you can control women. It’s the same bargain white women make when they support misogynist white men in power: if I acquiesce to you demeaning me because of my gender, you will at least allow me to demean others because of their race.  https://archive.ph/KPes2

PayPal was created by a company called Confinity, which later merged with X.com (Elon's company, a failed online bank). You can read more below:  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confinity

> Confinity Inc. was an American software company based in Silicon Valley, best known as the creator of PayPal. It was founded in December 1998 by Max Levchin, Peter Thiel, and Luke Nosek, initially as a Palm Pilot payments and cryptography company.[1]  
> 
> The company was launched in 1998 as Fieldlink and later renamed Confinity.[2] Many of Confinity's initial recruits were alumni of The Stanford Review, also co-founded by Thiel, and most early engineers hailed from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, recruited by Levchin.[3] Early investors included Nokia Ventures, Deutsche Bank, and William N. Melton, the founder of CyberCash.[4]
> 
> Confinity's second office, 165 University Avenue in Palo Alto, California, is also known for being the former office of Google and Logitech.[5]
> 
> **Confinity launched its milestone product, PayPal, in late 1999.[1] Confinity merged with X.com, founded by Elon Musk, in March 2000.[6]** The merged company became known as X.com because this was thought to be a name with broader long-term potential than Confinity or PayPal. However, surveys showed that a majority of consumers considered the name X.com vague and potentially pornographic and preferred that the company simply be called PayPal. After a corporate restructuring, which involved the removal of Elon Musk from the company, the company adopted the name PayPal Inc.[citation needed]
> 
> PayPal made an Initial Public Offering on the NASDAQ stock exchange on February 14, 2002.[7] The company was purchased by eBay in a $1.3 billion stock deal announced on July 8, 2002.[8] eBay and PayPal became separate companies in 2015.[9]",7,2024-11-06 14:37:55,Nayre_Trawe,6,False

People vote for Trump because they have different values than you or I... It's really that simple. People not voting for Kamala is the problem this election. She has 15-20M less votes than Biden in 2020, meanwhile Trumps numbers remained the same.

Ipso facto, that means the Dems need to get to work. There are people who voted Democrat in 2020 who didn't vote today. Your job, as a politician or political party, is to capture those votes back.

The democrats didn't run a candidate that was offering that.  I voted for Harris, I told everyone I know to vote for Harris.  I explained so many ways in which she would be better for the nation than Trump, but...

Hard times for working people lead to the election of populists, and the democrats have been preventing their populist wing from gaining access to the party's apparatus and power.

We can blame people for voting against their interests (and I do!) but that won't get them to vote for better candidates.  We have seen that 3 times now (Biden/Trump shouldn't have been half as close as it was, and Clinton and Harris both lost to him).

The Democrats need to change their strategy, or we're going to keep losing to fascists.  We need someone who is serious about new deal style populism to help working americans of all genders, orientations, races, etc...  And we need someone who can explain why they should vote for the democrat in terms a 5th grader could understand, because that is where the literacy of the masses is 40+ years after Reagan was elected.

One party can run a candidate that never hosts rallies and promises that nothing will change, and if thats what matters to you, you should vote for them.

What you should never do is say ""I don't like two of the X options on the ballot so I'm going to let others decide for me."" That's a childish approach - you're burying your head in the sand and trying to avoid the consequences of your actions.

The right, responsible, adult thing to do is to vote in every election you can for the person that best represents you. No one will be a perfect match, but if that's what you need, run for office yourself or find a candidate and encourage them to run.",1,2024-11-06 15:58:00,o-_l_-o,7,False

lvrv38h,t1_lvrq99h,"Inflation is more complex than just the cost of goods going up. It's about the overall purchasing power of the currency. When more money is in circulation, each dollar tends to hold less value, leading to higher prices across the board as it takes more dollars to buy the same items. This affects both domestic and imported goods. Additionally, when a country relies heavily on imported goods, currency fluctuations can make these imports more expensive, impacting the entire economy. Inflation reflects these combined pressures: not only the cost to produce goods but also monetary policy, demand, supply chains, and currency strength internationally.

Bringing manufacturing back home can help stabilize inflation by reducing dependence on imports and supporting domestic jobs. When goods are produced domestically, we retain the value created here rather than sending it abroad to reward businesses that often prioritize low-cost, low-quality products. Domestic manufacturing also helps stabilize supply chains, making it less likely for external disruptions or exchange rate changes to drive up prices. Keeping production internal promotes more sustainable economic growth by investing in higher-quality products and ethical practices, reinforcing a stronger, more resilient economy that circulates money domestically rather than supporting overseas knockoffs that undercut quality and values.

FYI. can't read yours it cause im not a subscriber but okay.

  
Unlike Kamala Trump clearly laid out that he wants to lean more in fossil fuels and cut some clean energy spending. You are acting like 4 years of investing fossil fuels will kill the environment. It won't. Many services require fossil fuels to run. Look at trucks for an example. Trucks need gas to travel the country. If they were electric then shipping would be even more expensive. The trip would be long and expensive if it were done on an electric battery. Thats only one example.

We will have to wait and see how drilling and less exporting will affect us. But I only see it being positive. Because what you want is for us to not drill ourselves but let others drill for us. We aren't solving any problem if we are the only country trying to do so. 

I will correct my statement and say its up in the air on if trump will fully peel back spending on clean energy. But stop acting so sure on what he will do. As I state I think he will do something in between and lean more into fossil fuels.

1. If we’re going purely by secular historical scholars, then Jesus was a supernatural preacher from over 2,000 years ago. Attempting to say that he would be on “my or your side” is anachronistic 

2. There’s still debate on whether or not the Gospels were eyewitness accounts, so whether or not the teachings and words of Jesus were truly from his own mouth are up for debate.

3. If we were to bring up “cherry-picking”, then virtually every single denomination and liberal/conservative theological group is guilty of picking and choosing. Conservatives would be guilty of what you suggested, and liberal or universalist/ annihilationist Christians are guilty of cherry-picking verses from the Gospel that do not mention judgment and a weeping and gnashing of teeth.

 --- 

 Supporters of Donald Trump typically share certain values and see him as embodying those values through his policies, rhetoric, and actions. While not all supporters are the same, there are common themes that resonate with his voter base: 

 Values Often Associated with Trump Supporters: 
1. Patriotism and Nationalism: Many Trump supporters are strong believers in American exceptionalism and prioritize policies that they believe protect U.S. sovereignty and interests. They value a sense of national pride and a commitment to what they see as traditional American values. 
2. Economic Conservatism: Supporters often value free-market principles, reduced taxation, and deregulation. They may see Trump as a leader who prioritizes business growth, job creation, and economic strength, emphasizing policies that support American industry and reduce foreign dependency. 
3. Law and Order: Many of Trump’s supporters value strong law enforcement, a well-defined immigration policy, and policies that they believe maintain public safety and social order. They may feel that Trump takes a hard stance against crime and illegal immigration. 
4. Cultural Conservatism: Many supporters align with traditional views on social and cultural issues, including religious freedom, opposition to certain progressive social changes, and preservation of traditional values related to family, religion, and community. 
5. Anti-Elitism and Populism: A significant portion of Trump’s base values anti-establishment rhetoric. They see Trump as a champion who challenges political correctness and the traditional political class, representing “the common man” against what they perceive as a powerful and out-of-touch elite. 
6. Individual Liberty: Supporters often value personal freedom, including support for the Second Amendment, freedom of speech, and opposition to government mandates that they perceive as overreach. 
7. Skepticism of Globalism: Many Trump voters are wary of global institutions and agreements that they believe compromise American autonomy or economic interests. They may support policies that prioritize America-first strategies and challenge international trade agreements or global policies seen as disadvantageous to the U.S.  

Values Trump Represents to Supporters: 
 • Assertive Leadership: Trump is often perceived as confident and decisive, embodying strength and resilience in the face of criticism. Supporters see this as an asset, believing that his brashness cuts through red tape and conveys authenticity. 
• Economic Strength: Trump represents a belief in bolstering the economy through business-friendly policies, including tax cuts and deregulation, which supporters feel drive growth and prosperity. 
 • National Pride and Patriotism: His rhetoric often centers on the greatness of America, which resonates with voters who prioritize national pride and a robust national identity. 
• Traditional Social Values: Through policies and statements, Trump often aligns with more conservative values related to issues like religion, marriage, and gender roles. 
• Skepticism of Mainstream Media and “The System”: Trump positions himself as a critic of mainstream media, which many supporters view as biased. They see him as someone who challenges misinformation and stands up against narratives they believe undermine their views.

For example, I have been having GAZA discussions with my kids and strangers, where I point out that Congress is responsible for foreign policy and the President has NO say. In fact, that is why they impeached Trump the first time when he stopped aid to Ukraine.  It is the House responsibility to change the terms when they received the ICC findings, but instead they invited Netanyahu to speak to Congress. The Israel Foreign policy has been in place since 2018 and last for 10-years until 2028. The regular citizen doesn't seem to be aware of this, so how do you educate them if they don't take the initiative to look? Would a person not be considered uneducated on this topic?  (Links below)

(stories for another day)  Tarrifs don't work the way he says so how do we educate people on that too.

I think if a progressive emerges AND   
  
1) Speaks 100% truthfully and plainly on real changes that are non-negotiable by using non-technical layman speak to people  
2) Drops the culture war issues that alienate and demonize white male workers, and drops focusing primarily and so heavily on transgender issues that do not reflect the day to day experiences of blue collar workers (I'm not suggesting supporting racism or transphobia, I'm suggesting not broadcasting these issues so often)  
3) Does not have a D or an R next to their name

they would have a real shot at building a competitive following. I always thought that every once in a while, you'd hear some MAGA member being interviewed that mentioned problems with this country that were remarkably resonant to real problems that need changed, but they were simply misdirected or mislead on what the causes of the issues were that need to be fixed. There are many there that seem to ache for change and they need to be informed (not scolded or made fun of) on how to get on the right track to making that a reality for both them and us. We all deserve to be in a better position than we are now. I really believe that.

lvt6mgq,t1_lvs9lyk,"First off, I just want to say that I have no formal education on this topic. I don't even belong to a church and am a second generation agnostic. I started reading the Bible when I was a young teen trying to find a path.  Because of this, I treat many stories in the Bible as allegorical. Some of my interpretations are probably heretical. For instance, I believe the food restrictions in Leviticus were meant to avoid food poisoning (from things like trichinosis, algae blooms, etc.). I also have an interpretation of Sodom and Gomorrah that is a bit different. I found it less of a condemnation of homosexuality and more of a condemnation of sexual violence. Rape was essentially used to keep people there in line. And of course, Lot's daughters later on showed how those dysfunctional values (probably learned from Sodom and Gomorrah's societal structure) were still deeply ingrained into them while in the cave with Lot.

To answer your first part, I think there is a distinct lack of empathy between the old and new testaments. For instance, Job had his lost children replaced after being tested like he wouldn't be still carrying the trauma from losing his original children. 

With Jesus, however, we get a more personal look at his familial relationships. For instance, he turns water into wine because he wants to help his mother fretting about trying to organize a wedding party. Later on, he gets crucified and still shows doubt, despite being the son of God, due to incomprehensible pain. Now whether he is supernatural or not is incredibly hard to prove, but it honestly boils down to what he preached. During that time, there was a sense of power makes right. The ancient Romans believed heavily in a master/slave dynamic where the master was celebrated. Being the master was goal; yet, Jesus said that the slave and master were equal in God's eyes; and even more so, that the slave holder was going to be judged far more harshly than the slave. This is revolutionary for that time period, imo. And most importantly, I think this is the reason why Christianity spread in the way that it did. It uplifted the downtrodden in a time where emperors were being celebrated as Gods on earth.

Christ teachings were even more radical because it completely separated material existence from immaterial. ""Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's and render unto God what is God's"" is radical in that it implies institutional powers don't have to fully control and dominate the spirit of a human being. This is the reason why it doesn't bother me if Jesus was supernatural or not, because what was documented was transformational and literally moved human understanding forward when it comes to power. 

For your second point, I tend to believe what the apostles documented had some truth considering how transgressive what they were saying was to the status quo at the time. 

3rd part. Cherry picking is going to happen. I cherry picked In this very post, but intentions matter, imo. I am not trying to justify evil actions people made in the name of Christ. After-all, he said to give the other cheek to someone who slapped you. Because of that, I can't say Jesus would co-sign anyone who slays or oppresses or gets rich for God.

4th part. I agree in a way but I also heard in my own life that people will judge you for who you associate with. In a time where hierarchy deeply mattered, claiming to be the son of God while freely associating with the lowest castes is gonna draw some ire from higher ups who have gained their power from subjugation. Basically saying that these people society looks down upon are just as valuable in God's eyes as royalty or the priesthood. Incredibly transgressive, and an incredibly important moment for human history, imo.

You see so many of them happy to reap the benefits of having their currency as a global standard, how their culture is everywhere, how they can travel to pretty much any country with their passport and also have a reasonable expectation that they'll be able to find someone to speak English to, but when you point out any critique (legitimate or not), suddenly it's ""not their/our fault"".

Trump has very few actual policies written out. How are gas and grocery prices going to decrease under trump? 

Gas wasn’t cheaper under trump last time (https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2024/07/12/were-gas-prices-under-trump-lower/). 

Groceries weren’t cheaper under trump last time (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/average-cost-grocery-staples-trump-230038598.html). Grocery prices essentially remain consistent when accounting for inflation.

A president hardly has any effect on gas prices. And a slightly larger affect on grocery prices.

That’s what I mean by “voting for policy”. The trump voters arent “voting for policy” because there’s no policy trump has that would actually lead to lower prices. They’re voting based on hatred of dems, some type of team spirit, victimhood complex, and then on buzzwords the trump campaign throws out on instagram like “gas and groceries will be cheaper”. They have no understanding of the actual economics or policy decisions that affect prices of either gas or groceries. If they did they wouldn’t be so confident that trump can affect things like gas and grocery prices. That’s fair because very few people have a real understanding of economics or politics, but every person probably should start being a little more versed in that.

As for climate change, they were predicting things decades in advance for…. Decades. Some people can only understand what happens right in front of them - some people can understand how natural systems work. Climate change is very simple. Carbon dioxide sits in the atmosphere and traps energy. It literally works the same way as glass in the greenhouse. 

Climate change is happening and it’s more evident every year. Weather patterns are changing. NC just got what might be a ten thousand year flood with trillions of dollars in damages. Upstate NY got more tornados in one week than they ever have had in a whole year. It’s 80 degrees in November in Watertown NY this week. 

People have been warning against climate change for decades - oil companies actually found proof of climate change as early as the 1960s and spend millions of dollars covering that truth. 

https://commonhome.georgetown.edu/topics/climateenergy/defense-denial-and-disinformation-uncovering-the-oil-industrys-early-knowledge-of-climate-change/

Some things take a long time to get going… climate change is similar to the concept of inertia. It will start rolling slowly… once it picks up speed, it will be very hard to stop. I hope there is no climate change! That would be great! But we have to operate under our best assumptions. 

Can I ask you why you think climate change is a hoax? How would this possibly be a hoax by some deep state agenda? The most powerful companies and people on earth don’t benefit from upsetting the status quo, doing an energy transition, and ceasing oil production and use. All the most powerful companies - steel, oil, plastic - all benefit from denying climate change. So why think it’s a hoax? The rich also have the least to lose with climate change because they have the resources to deal with it - so why not deny it and continue with business as usual. If it doesn’t happen, their wealth kept growing. If it does happen, they will afford property and compounds in New Zealand and northern Canada and Argentina while the rest of the world kills each other for drinking water.

The republicans deny climate change. Trump denies climate change. The denial of climate change helps the most powerful and richest people on earth. Trump is helping the most powerful and richest people on earth. How is trump some outsider when he’s helping everyone who runs the world? He’s moreso someone who will consolidate the power and the wealth at the top between even smaller amount of people. The status quos will change - but not in a way that helps anyone working class.

From the outside looking on, they seem more interested in having power within the GOP than ""not judging lest ye be judged"". Their personal interpretations of the faith are their prerogative and choice; however, they're using excerpts to justify oppressive legislation and stripping people of their rights in a secular society. Another problem, like you mentioned with the no-true Scotsman fallacy, is that Jesus isn't physically here to tell us exactly what it is that he meant. We can only go by what was claimed to have been said which can be interpreted many different ways. Some ways that can inspire people to do great things like getting involved with abolitionist movements. Some other ways inspire people to commit acts of genocide.

I think a positive approach is to encourage people who have positive interpretations that inspire them to help the infirm, feed the poor, stick up for those who can't help themselves, etc. while also discouraging people who use their personal interpretation to yell at people that they don't like that they are going to burn in hell for eternity. I mean, of the two people, who is going to be a better ambassador of the faith? One interpretation makes the faith tolerable while the other interpretation actively creates enemies and drives people away. 

To your last point, in order for faith to survive human progress and an increased understanding of our natural existence, we have to reconcile what we know now to what was going on back then to what our faith personally means to us.

During that same time period anti abortion rhetoric started becoming more popular. I was raised catholic but never bothered to think about abortion until after 2016. I ended up in an antinabortion preyer group because of it. 

In addition the uptake in homophobic and transphobic hate speech in America and Canada had a trickle down affect where I live.

I’m not really sure I’m following where you’re going regarding the money driven and power hungry Christian conservatives in the GOP. Even if I agree regarding that those type of Christians rampantly exist in the GOP, aren’t you also being guilty of not following “not judging lest be judged” by judging the authenticity of their beliefs? It just sounds like to me that judging in of itself isn’t wrong. Is judging permissible to judge based on the amount of harm the accused has exerted? Or depending on what the accused is guilty of?

Helping the sick, feeding the poor, sticking up for those who can’t stick up for themselves are admirable qualities and ones that are consistent with many of Christian virtues, but also aren’t exclusive to Christianity or religion/ spirituality as a whole.

Even if it’s a form of control, ironically the lack of a supernatural afterlife consequence, good or bad, gives less of a reason (outside of purely physical ones, which I’ll get to later) to stay in a faith.Like your “soul” isn’t in jeopardy if you stop “believing” or even if you indulge in the most abominable ideologies or practice in secular society (like N*zism), what’s at stake is solely materialistic. Jail, social condemnation, retaliation etc. Many “bad” people are judges of their own destiny anyways and wouldn’t consider themselves bad people. It’s the same with heaven, if everyone will make it to paradise, then what’s the point?


It’s tolerable from an outside perspective that doesn’t drive people away, but also at the same time doesn’t bring people back into faith either. It’s no secret that in previous culturally Protestant / Catholic societies in the Anglosphere are becoming less of that religion (with some exceptions). The church attendance amongst other polls and research are signs of this. What’s kind of ironic is how atheists/agnostics who see this as a victory for secular society don’t realize that this shift and decline isn’t solely tied to conservative places of worship but ALSO liberal to progressive as well. But my theory is that the ones who do realize this, aren’t losing sleep over this revelation, as they are aware that they can find what the more progressive interpretations offer in other places in a secular society. They definitely see progressive believers as allies but aren’t going to risk themselves trying to “save” the progressive churches /mosques/ synagogues etc either 

Also, if we go purely by the direct quotes attributed to Jesus in the New Testament, regardless of their reliability , would that make Jesus ironically a terrible ambassador of the faith as a lot of his messages were intolerant or full of doomsday preaching? Or is Christianity as we know it now entirely different from whatever Jesus and the earliest apostles and followers were practicing?

Personally, I see religion becoming niche in most of the secular“West” (again with a few exceptions), regardless of how much specific churches attempt to become more progressive and inclusive or more traditionalist and exclusive.",1,2024-11-08 20:33:13,Ecstatic_Clue_5204,3,False

Hitler started with deportation and then rounded them up and put them into concentration camps. The Jews were the victim. Crazy Germans who bought into this did horrible horrible things. 

Have you heard the way Trump talks about immigrants?  Sure sounds like he thinks they are inferior.

>Trump wants to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport illegal aliens who crossed into the United States ILLEGALLY. Some of these people crossing are not nice people and are part of violent gangs who hurt other people. They shouldn’t be in the country to begin with. 

So screw all the immigrants who aren't criminals and settled down for a nice life and contributed to our economy by taking cheap labor jobs no one else wants? Or were brought here as children.

And none of this has anything to do with me pointing out that Trump referenced the AEA and the similarities this bears to Hitler when he tried to deport the Jews

>The alien enemies act can only be used when congress declares war. We are not at war. It will be challenged in court obviously because of that. It might never be used. 

He still referenced it.  Which was my original point.  But also, will it?  The Court just gave him permission to break the law...

>We have one side that thinks one group of people should be exterminated. We have another side that thinks people who crossed a border illegal should not be in the country. 

>Comparing someone to Hitler and his supporters to the Nazis is an insane way to think about half the country. It’s actually disgraceful.

You literally ignored my point.  Yes some details are different, but Hitler didn't just order the death of the Jews. He tried to mass deport them, as you said.  Trump is promising to mass deport immigrants.  Similarity.  Pretty much the only thing that you pointed out was that the Jews were victims and immigrants deserve it.  Sound pretty fucking similar 

Dude has literally praised Hitler, wouldn't denounce Nazis, wants to be a dictator, and wants to mass deport minorities.  Sure sounds like it's reasonable to compare him to Hilter.

Also, there are other solutions to illegal immigration.  And their criminality and effect on the economy has been grossly exaggerated.  You are way more likely to be a victim of a crime perpetuat3d by an America than an immigrant.  Shouldn't we focus on that instead?  Because even if and that's a big if, mass deportation is successful pulled off, it's going to cost the government millions of dollars and crash the economy.  The farmer industry is dependent on immigrant labor. Not to mention tearing families apart and making thousands homeless.

lw6dfnw,t1_lw5yq3r,"I guess this is why the first amendment is important, because it does provide protections to people with various beliefs. The secularist part of our government, however, is to prevent one person's faith preference from dominating over others to include those who don't believe. I am not trying to use my interpretation of the faith to pass legislation that restricts the rights of others. When they try to force legislation that aligns with their religious views, they're saying that their interpretation of the faith is the only real one. And considering all of the religious persecutions and wars that have occurred in the past due to that kinda mindset, I believe there is potential for great harm. For this reason, my opinion on it isn't coming from a damning judgemental attitude but from a discerning one.

Having said that, I also believe religion is often an important part of some communities' culture, heritage, and history. Does that mean it's okay for those very communities to put their boot on the throats of people who believe differently, no.

People moving away from religious institutions is of their own choice. It is up to leadership in those institutions to figure out a way to reach out to them that doesn't involve forcing them to stay or forcing an entire nation to fall into line as well.

When people throw around that the world will end on this date but nothing happens, I personally feel like they're focusing on the wrong things. Same thing with blaming other groups of people who exist today for his crucifixion. I feel like there are better uses for that energy.

I totally believe that doing good for others and being a decent person isn't exclusive to Christianity/spirituality. Atheists are probably more incentivized to have a better world and society than those who believe in an afterlife since they view this life as the only one. 

I generally agree that we are going to see more people drifting away from religious institutions as well. Hopefully as they leave, they'll move more into a humanistic direction rather than something like Qanon.

lwpl4v9,t1_lvxwz4a,"Strong vibes of ""We destroyed the planet, but for a while groceries went down"" ! Some crops are already failing around the world, I'm sure climate change will do wonder for your bills !

But really, the problem was not inflation becoming a decisive issue, of course it is. I could explain that it is a global issue, that the USA fared way better than any other, or even that a lot of it is driven by greedflation upon which the president has no power.

But no need, because the stupidity gets much much simpler : to combat inflation, the US voted for the candidate that has promised to... put Tarrifs on everything. Yeah, new taxes on buying abroad will get prices down, that is totally not stupid.

As for International issues, I agree with that the afghan withdrawal was butched for sure, but from my point of view, the real mistake was the whole 15 years, not just the ending.

But the rest, I really don't get :

\- You lament the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, but support a president that want its resistance to end and Putin to obtain exactly what he wanted. Which will embolden other would-be conquerors to try the same thing.

\- You fear to be on a verge of war with Iran, but support a president that scrapped the Iran deal. The JCPOA was far from perfect, but it was a step toward peace and negociation, and since it got destroyed we are only getting closer to war, egged on by Trump great friend, Bibi.

\- You lament how Israel and Ukraine do whatever they want with your money, while the enablers sit on Congress that keeps on voting huge help packages without conditions. Netanyahu and Zelensky don't respect your president because they know that he doesn't really matter in the equation. Especially Bibi, he need no Biden or Trump when he has his AIPAC buddies.

As for ""any kind of respect on the international stage"", Biden and Harris did command some respect, but that was from democratic leaders from, you know, your allies, especially in NATO.

Putin, Netanyahu and other autocrats don't respect Trump, they just know that best case scenario he will agree with them, worst case he'll just don't care and let them be.

\- Ok, your first point is about the situation of the average American :

Yeah, you are getting screwed and taken advantage of. By your own set of laws that so absurdly benefit huge companies and Rich peoples. May I remind you that you are the only OECD country to not have Universal Healthcare ? How is it the fault of anyone else than you guys?

""If you are elected you owe it to take care of your own citizens first."" Pleaaase, the last guy that did that for you was probably Jimmy fucking Carter !

Since basically Reagan, you guys kept voting for people that openly screwed the middle class, to the point it is actually disappearing in the US. You kept getting suckered by the low tax bullshit again and again .

And now you decided to react and finally put a stop to it by... electing a billionaire known for not paying his bills, who says out loud that he hates overtime and would rather fire people. A billionaire who coopted another billionaire, known for his hate of unions and workers for the express purpose of cutting like a 3rd of the Federal budget. Think about all the services that 1/3rd provides to the American people.

Now let's get back to Healthcare : The USA spends about 17.5% of GDP on Healthcare, the rest of OECD spends 10 to 12% of GDP. Precisely because in the rest of OECD, Healthcare is socialized, This makes it way cheaper, because of economy of scale and bargaining power, mostly. The end results is that Americans pay way more for Healthcare than other OECD people.

The same will happen with all these services that the Federal budget buy if they are cut. Americans will still need them but they will be provided by the private sector and will now cost way more. Add in the whole Tariffs madness and you get a recipe for the empowerishment of American on a scale never seen before.

It just doesn't make any sense. At all. You keep getting suckered to vote for rich people that promise you low taxes. You've been doing it for 50 years and all you got for it is the situation getting worse and worse for the average american.

50 years ago you could buy a house and raise a big family on a working class salary.

50 years ago you didn't start your working life with 10's or 100's thousands dollars of debt just because you wanted an education.

50 years ago your streets were not littered with homeless people and drug addicts.

50 years ago, your population was not ""dying of despair"", overdosing Fentanyl by the tens of thousands.

50 years ago your kids were not dying in school shootings on a daily basis.

Look back, and wake the fuck up ! Please...

\- Your second point about why Eastern Ukraine defence should cost YOU money :

The simple answer :

They wish to be your ally and are being attacked by one of your sworn ennemy that is set up to benefit greatly should they succeed. I don't even understand how this can be a question coming from someone hailing from the Cold War winner. This is how you won it, dammit !

You... you know that Russia wants to destroy the US democracy and US power, right ?  That is a real question ! You know it, right ? Because that is not a conspiracy, it is clearly stated by russian authority. Like they actually boast about it ! My god, Bush Jr really did a number on you guys...

The more complex answer :

Again, we come back to the fact that you are the Hegemon, THE Superpower. The USA have shaped the world to their liking and benefit through 80 years of being a superpower. Since 1989, the fact that it was the ONLY superpower allowed it to benefit even more.

Huge part of it is being the World Police. You set up an order that benefit you, and you protect the order to defend these benefits. Your rules, your house. If you allow someone to actually flaunt your order, to act as they please and make their own right, you forfeit your authority, your power and soon, the benefits. Their rules, their house.

And when I talk about benefits, believe that I am speaking about cold hard cash that flows and waters the US economy. There is a reason you guys are allowed to be whatever Trillions of dollars in debt without ever crashing down, and that is it : you are the Hegemon.

The US world order, PAX AMERICANA, as they call it, is predominatly rule-based. It is faaaar from a real State of Right, but still, you follow the rules of Uncle Sam and he lets you share some of that yummy globalized money, that's the deal. And one of the rules of Old Sam, the main one actually, is : don't invade your neighbors, that shit is really bad for business.

This is why, even if the invader wasn't Russia, an avowed ennemy of the USA, it would still be highly worth of your hard earned cash to help the defender. Because it is a direct attack, a clear act of defiance against the World Order which the prosperity of the average American is built upon.

Conclusion : A world less and less rigged to profit the USA, the institution of high tariffs and the destruction of Public Services, what a fucking trifecta ! Holy shit you guys are gonna be shred to pieces...",1,2024-11-14 16:03:29,O-Otang,4,False

Trump will see his priorities as he has always seen them: party over country and self over all. 

>  A man with 34 felony convictions can’t win the presidency in a nation where trust in institutions is high. It’s only in a culture where the justice system has long since lost its legitimacy that a man with such a thick criminal record as Trump glides by relatively unremarked. That one man can so effortlessly game American institutions to his own benefit says as much about the decrepit state of America’s institutions as it does about the moral decrepitude of the crook.

That was a book about what would happen if Roosevelt had not run for a third term, and
 Nazis had taken over the US government.

Of course that did not happen in WWII. Roosevelt continued in office, and helped Churchill
 win WWII. In fact, Roosevelt took the dominant part, and worked himself to death.

It looks like we in the USA are now going down the road in the book, instead of taking the
 road of the heroes in WWII. Trump has already announced that everyone who supported Harris
 is now in danger of arrest and being placed in a concentration camp. I worry for myself, my
 children, and I worry most of all for the people of Ukraine, who are now in the position of
 Poland in 1939.

lvrpbbp,t3_1gl0ty4,"Young people, take this election as opportunity to deepen your understanding of the world and how it functions on a fundamental level. This defeat may seem wholly negative but with a new perspective, you should remain hopeful that it will work out in the end. 

First, you must acknowledge a few universal truths: 

**Task vs Purpose**

You are but one cog in a massive machine called Humanity. Each cog has a unique task, but all cogs serve the same purpose, and that is to advance our species. The foot presses the pedal, the hands steer the wheel, and the eyes plot the path forward. Together, they serve one singular purpose and that is to move from the machine from point A to point B. 

Father, Mother, Smith, Warrior (Game of Thrones, anyone?). Artist, Doctor, Engineer, Professional Athlete...The fates assigned each of us with a task or two in life, and together, we complete our tasks to achieve the same purpose. No task is more or less important than the other because each uniquely highlights what it means to be human. Each is an expression of the human heart, mind, and soul. Sometimes the fates change and we assume a new task, whether we like it or not. Regardless of how we might feel about our tasks, they remain essential to achieve our purpose.

At times, the path we are on may seem uncertain and you may question those who have been appointed as our eyes, but remember this, our ancestors of the Dawn felt the same as you do now. Their chapter of life, full of good and bad, paved the way for our space flight. What will result from our chapter? That remains a mystery, but we do know that the recipe for the future is in our DNA.



**Yin and Yang**

We live in a dualistic cosmology, meaning there are two fundamental concepts in life, and these two concepts are everywhere, expressed in different ways: Hot vs Cold, Light vs Dark, Life vs Death, Right vs Left, Expansion vs Contraction, Conservative vs Liberal, Aggressive vs Passive, Positive vs Negative.

Don't be so quick to assume that one force must be good and the other bad, or that when they meet, it must result in a winner and a loser. No, when these opposing forces meet, the result is electric. 

By themselves, each force is useless. How will we know the light if we have not first obtained knowledge of the dark? How will we feel the comfort of warmth, if we have not first felt the chill of cold? It's only together that the two forces function as intended. Like iron sharpens iron, they make each other stronger. Together, we grow.



**Growth = Expansion and Contraction**

Summer turns to winter and the leaves fall. Winter turns to summer and the flowers spring. Our muscles only grow when stretched and strained. Our minds only sharpen when introduced to more difficult concepts. The human soul only shines when the world around us darkens. Whether Heart, Mind, or Soul, nothing can truly *thrive* unopposed. We are *designed* to fail before we first succeed. A story without conflict will never be remembered.



**Perspective**

Earlier, I claimed that with a new perspective, you can find hope for the future of our nation. To do so, you must acknowledge this: our purpose, our destination, is neither all red nor all blue, neither all conservative nor all liberal because our purpose is a more perfect **Union** of the two**.** It's our eyes, one red and the other blue, that work together to determine the path forward. Without both eyes, we would only see in 2 dimensions rather than 3.

For a time, sometimes two or even three, one eye may become dominant. When that happens, it does not render the other weak. It asks the other to be patient for a while, to allow it the opportunity to experience all the world has to offer through it's own lens, to solve a problem that maybe the other doesn't see. And it asks the other to be there when it falters, to pick it back up having learned its mistakes.

  
**Optimism vs Pessimism**

Our nation may regret the decision to elect Donald Trump, but like all that you just read, it will only be for a time. Rather than spout doom and gloom to strangers on the internet, and declare the end of the world under his leadership, remember that our earliest ancestors once felt that way too. 

Maturing is realizing that your life is an expression of the human heart, mind and soul, and that you cannot truly *thrive* if any of these three things go unopposed. Take delight in opposing perspectives or new challenges, for all of it works together to achieve the same purpose. 

You may not like the outcome of the election nor the direction in which our nation is headed. Inevitably, Trump will fail at times, so learn from his mistakes and be there, sharpened, when the pendulum swings back your way.",2,2024-11-06 16:43:19,Ciabattabingo,0,True

Having the belief that 2017-2020 wasn't so bad is reductive. Governance takes ages to build, refine, maintain, adapt, refine again. Tearing down years of standards, research direction, trust, expertise, recruitment incentives (within budget), behind the scenes of every citizens daily lives isn't ""not too bad"". What happens with the IRS, FDA, CDC are gutted of authority, expertise, budget, standards? Is that bad to the average citizen? Is that being taken for granted for, from a place of privilege? 

I'm just astounded by the disdain for governance coming out of that subreddit right now.

Project 2025 is not a conspiracy, it's literally the blueprint. And Trump will either carry it out or they'll remove him and Vance will handle it. And because of how this election went, they're not just looking at this as an opportunity, but a mandate to enact these policies. 

It can't be overstated the trouble we're in here. Social security, Medicare, Medicaid, abortion, ACA, separation of church and state, and public education are all on the chopping block. The days of sick and/or unemployed people just not being able to obtain health insurance are coming back.  Any climate protection measures are gone and we're going full bore back into coal and oil. Plus we're looking at the spectre of another shift further to the right on the supreme court. 

Ukraine is done and Taiwan will be taken by China. Russia and North Korea will become more powerful and our allies will be left trying to pick up the slack. We will block any new NATO candidates that Russia doesn't support and alienate ourselves from the rest of NATO.

But saying that 17 million people that voted differently than you that they are “dumb and uneducated” is an ignorant statement. That’s not the case…people just simply have different views. Certain issues are more important to certain people. 17 million people have different experiences  based on these issues and they voted accordingly. If you want to call these people idiots and racists because that makes you feel better then go ahead, it’s free speech. But that doesn’t make it true.  Whether you like it or not this is democracy. If you don’t like the way our system works and you feel these issues are extremely important to you then maybe consider looking into moving somewhere that has what you’re looking for. 

Now for anyone who vocally hates Trump or hates anyone for that matter on either side. Why do we feel like saying we hate someone gives us any grounds for an argument? When you hate someone your opinions are blinded by it. Your mind is closed off. We should not be listening to these people on either side. Same with people who are overly obsessed with Trump and think he can do no wrong. I will gladly listen to a liberal who doesn’t have hatred for Trump but says they have concerns and explains why. I will listen to that over the person that says “screw you, I want nothing to do with you if you voted for Trump.” It’s the same if someone hates Kamala. I’m not going to take them seriously. So let’s stop the hate on both sides. It does nothing. It won’t make people hear you or change opinions. It’s just making people tired and angry. We should be vocal about concerns but stop calling people names.

m8cpyzd,t3_1gl0ty4,"As someone who isn't American, I can't understand how the warning signs weren't obvious. Whilst I appreciate his opposition performed 'poorly' (I appreciate there are circumstances such as Biden stepping down mid-way through his campaign), Trump himself allegedly stood for the working class, yet aligned himself with those from privileged backgrounds. His policies themselves stood and stand for hate, particularly towards those deemed illegal migrants and the LGBTQ community. 

Standing alongside JD Vance, a man who decidedly tweeted the 'UK is the first Islamist country with nuclear weapons'(https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/07/16/labour-uk-first-islamist-nuclear-power-jd-vance/), a statement charged with hate and racism, and the well known and loved Elon Musk, who's takeover of the now aptly named X (marking the grave of a once great social media) has only encouraged and emboldened hate speech and extremist far right groups.

Musk himself is an interesting ally, a man now who owns one of the biggest platforms people use for news, politics and socialising. Considering that people were being paid to spread disinformation on the platform at the time (https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2dpj485nno), it appears that Musk attempted to skew and distort the minds and opinions of those oh so important swing voters by feeding them blatant lies and misinformation. Furthermore, re-mentioning his approval of far-right hate speech, going as far as saying Tommy Robinson, a known extremist and classified terrorist, be elected as head of the UK's Reform party (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7ve4m1q42vo). 

Disregarding all of the legal issues Trump faced, aligning himself with such an individual who holds such power and influence over the media people consume, especially considering Musk's own political stance and his readiness to involve it within his platform, does it not scare those who truly believe in a free America? Trump has constantly used the term 'fake news' throughout his campaigns, yet is himself the source of many racist lies (Haitian citizen's eating cats and dogs claim:https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77l28myezko), and has only further involved himself by including Musk as his right hand man.  

His recent actions only further demonstrate his true intentions: to re-ignite the America we know in the history books, that which commited heinous acts against its own citizens (MKUltra, NSA/Snowden), that involved itself in foreign wars for the supposed 'greater good' (This time uninvolving itself for the greater evil), and one which imposed a true double citizenship dependant on one's race and wealth.

One country should not have such influence over the world. With Trump's recent move to back out of WHO, and his most definite removal of funding to Ukraine, the last remaining peace in Europe may well be lost.

I do not blame those who voted for him, for the real issue lies within the system itself. When only two true choices can be made, the whole country hangs in the balance of a coin flip. For a country supposedly the pariah of freedom, where is the freedom in choice of a government?

I pray for all those in America and across the world who will be negatively affected by this government and its actions. Today, it appears hate has won.",2,2025-01-21 11:33:39,vortey65,0,True

After we are beat down and people are purged and elections cant happen, how will we possibly be able to properly regret our single greatest disastrous decision that will have world wide consequences for the next 100 years.     Trump is now free to be the dictator he wants to be.  The Supremes have given him unlimited, unchecked power.   He will have a minimum of 2 additional supreme picks, and if Vance is installed after him (if trump actually lives long enough and willingly ends his second term) we will have a potential 8 more years of BS to live through.  So we now have a potential shit storm that our only real chance to recover from wont be for a minimum of 10 years.

After all the hate, after the tear down of our safety nets, after all the tariffs and the lack of medical care, and the abolishing of the department of education and Musk's ""needed hardship that the rest of us"" must endure (he wont suffer anything) America will be unrecognizable.

Here are some free tips DNC:

\- Don't run a candidate that performed poorly in 2020 primaries

I would love to buy American made goods and keep the money in our communities (but damn do the Japanese make a great car).

Young Voters: 

Aged 18 - 29 support decreased support for the DNC by 11 percentage points



Latino Men: 

GOP gained 18% in their support


(source: Business Insider)

Black Voters:

GOP gained 8% 

Economic issues:

Over 60% of GenZ (aged 18-25) still live at home. 

TD Ameritrade found that 91% of young adults living with their parents expressed a desire to move out eventually.

The same survey highlighted that 50% of these young adults cited financial instability as the primary barrier to moving out


The primary issue among voters in these brackets was the economy. A lot of young people are stuck living with their parents and began to see no way out. Party allegiance became less important and instead young voters and Latino males, and black Americans favored a solution.

I do not want to listen to you concede.  
Not tonight, at 6 pm, as darkness falls  
And hatred is set free upon the land.  
Not tonight, when I feel the crosshairs  
Trained and taking aim  
At my gayness,  
Ready to fire on my younger sister’s choices,  
Preparing a mass deportation of the suddenly voiceless.  
We, the targeted, cannot hear you concede.

Advisors may advise you to compromise,  
To show respect for our democracy,  
To do what we’d want,  
Were we on the other side —  
But we need you to put all of that aside  
Because yesterday,  
our democracy voted for suicide  
And we need you to refuse  
To carry out that directive.

I cannot listen to you concede  
Because we are not giving up.  
Remember?  
We are STILL not going back  
And we need you to remind us of that.  
So say the words that your respect for the law demands  
But say them softly and with steady hands  
And then  
Call us to battle to protect this land.

Call on the military  
To refuse unconstitutional orders,  
Call on the governors to block the use of the National Guard  
To quell protests,  
And call on us  
To build those protests.

We did not stop the election of a fascist  
But we can stop the implementation of his program,  
So I will not listen to you concede  
Because you are speaking for me  
And I am not resigned.  
I concede nothing.  
I will not go gently,  
Or quietly,  
Or humbly.  
I will not speak suddenly softly now,  
I will rouse my country until she looks in the mirror  
With horror  
At what she has allowed herself to become.

Yesterday, our democracy voted for suicide.

lvrgqm5,t3_1gl0ty4,"As a Canadian and I just don't understand this. I was working in the states during Trump's first election run and was stunned when he won given his performance in the debates and the comments he would make, e.g., climate change is a hoax perpetuated by China to undermine the US economy. 

When he won I boycotted any trips to the US but watched how he ran his presidency and created so much division across the states and the rest of the world, was responsible for so many Covid related deaths. Don't even get me started on his attempt to overturn the 2020 election as he drove his supporters to storm the US Capitol Building. 

I am so very disappointed by the overwhelming amount of support he has now received across the states in support of the elimination of women’s rights, the demonization of immigrants, and his overall message of hatred, division and misogyny.

It’s time for me to step away from US politics and focus on what is going on here and the rest of the world.

Looking from the UK, we've seen a steady stream of stupid right wing decisions over the last decade.

Trump 1
Brexit
Various Conservative wins in elections here
Boris Johnson
Nigel Farage
Liz Truss
Far right resurgences in some European countries
And now Trump 2

Each of these has left an unholy mess, and they all have 1 thing in common - the people who ultimately made those decisions never end up regretting it and the people making the mess are never held to account.

Boris had to leave politics but he still has a sizeable core of supporters who want to see his comeback. The brexiteers still think we just ""did brexit wrong"". Liz Truss should have disappeared by now but instead has been invited to give talks to conservatives in the US, as if her advice is somehow helpful to them.
Our Conservative party surged to the right over the last decade, has only just recently taken a kicking at the election, and instead of seeing the error of its ways, has elected a new leader who is even further to the right than the last ones.

lvrx0tq,t3_1gl0ty4,"A bunch of ""it'll be worse than right now, I swear."" Not a lot of logic. Last time tariffs were reduced in America it was post WW2 with GATT. Primary purpose was to allow European and Asian countries to reestablish their economies and begin functioning as a proper society again after the huge losses of life. Those tariffs never got brought back up due to lobbying by mega-corps who had just started moving operations overseas in the 50s and 60s for the cheaper labor costs (never, as in only ever changed in tiny margins in select industries such as the Steel Tariffs in the Bush admin & VERs which was a reaction to foreign countries finally stabilizing). Add in the moronic culture war of ""McCarthyism"" in the late 50s up til the 70s (eventually transforming into what was more recently referred to as ""Traditional American Values"" which is obviously a misnomer) as well as large-scale lobbying/funding efforts of the corporations of the modern age and you wind up with a perfectly logical reasoning for why tariffs have been largely untouched by American politics for the better part of a century. Europe is functional again. Japan, despite its problems, has been economically autonomous for decades. We have established trade agreements like the USMCA and KORUS FTA that protect many of our friends around the world. It's time to take the training wheels off.

Tariffs may actually give China a reason to start improving worker salaries, as undercutting American production is no longer a viable long-term strategy. Caring and investing in the lives/welfare of their own citizens may be the only reasonable path forward in the face of significantly reduced consumer demand. Obviously a pretty big hypothetical but still one based in fact. 

Finally, foreign nations already impose tariffs on American goods. 3% in Germany (with higher tariffs on main imports like automobiles), India installed tariffs in excess of 50% at times, and China (one of our largest trading partners) hits us with upwards of 100% on complex goods, if they even let you do business in their country at all. The reestablishment of tariffs stands to improve the current debt crisis. Combine that with a reduced spending overseas from negotiated peace agreements, decreased government spending (especially overspending. Talk to a couple american servicemen/women, they all have stories of a particular part having engineered-obsolescence while being incredibly delicate and expensive), and increased natural resource utilization. We might actually have a chance to avoid bankruptcy apocalypse that is ever-looming.

As a caveat, his perspective on wildlife preservation as well as the suggestion of separating families where an illegal immigrant has lived in the U.S. for over 5 years are both ridiculous. As long as you've committed no violent crime (DUI w/injury should be included as violent crime, but should require review of current behaviors), if you've been in the country for 5 years it's innately unethical and kind of meaningless to deport at that point. These people are part of our community by then, treating them as less than neighbors is wrong. How ""Possession with intent"" is treated should be based on the presence of particularly dangerous narcotics (fentanyl, heroine, etc.) in substances other than fentanyl or heroine. Selling weed is one thing, selling it laced with literal poison is another. All other minor drug charges shouldn't matter. But if you've watched the videos from Afghanistan after the pull-out or god forbid some of the videos from the Darién Gap, you would have some genuine fear for what might happen if we allow bad actors into the country. Plus, their crimes would largely affect poorer, already disenfranchised communities. A better strategy barely-even-suggested is to aid these governments properly to solve this problem on their own turf, but the three letter agencies have been in bed with the cartels since the 60s, largely to the dismay of meso+south america (as well as black communities with the crack epidemic being largely orchestrated by the CIA.)

The main problem with a representative system is you have to trust that candidates will actually act on the policies they run on. We already saw this problem with Biden and the illusive promise of forgiving student loans (which I am largely for, and confounded as to why conservatives complain about investing in America's youth). My point being, either candidate could do any, all, or none of the things they say and there's basically no recourse. But, Kamala spent 3 months giving no path forward, recanted most of the few positions she held, and ran on empathy while wearing Tiffany necklaces worth more than the down payment on a house. Voting Blue No Matter Who/Red or Dead is a terrible way to live your life. Think these things through, don't just listen to MSNBC or Fox News to tell you the facts, since they both have proven they're more shaky than a ladder made of raw spaghetti. I can defend the positions that I hold with facts because they're MY beliefs that I came to with research into the subjects. And while Trump has a number of flaws, it's better than endorsing someone who I know is in the same camp of the war-profiteer Dick Cheney who (you older Dems should remember, because I do) has been called every name under the sun for being a warhawk while invested in military arms companies.",1,2024-11-06 17:18:27,SuspiciousAd3522,0,True

In today’s world, that security is not something to be taken for granted. However, I can't help but feel a growing sense of fear and uncertainty about the potential international consequences of current policies, the rising cost of everything with the coming isolationism, and, most concerning of all, the possibility of losing the health insurance young people rely on.

While I am thankful for the privileges and opportunities I have, I am deeply troubled by what I perceive as a looming crisis.

You know: Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness and all that jazz. I don't believe what the media tells us. I don't trust the government to have our best interest at heart. I don't think our problem lies with Republican/Democrat, White/Black, Nationality/Nationality. Our problem is that we have forgotten exactly how much power we TRULY have against our government. Declaration of Independence: ""whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it"" and ""to provide new guards for their future security."" We have been beat down and broken to the point of utter apathy. The government puts their hands where they don't belong. They forcibly insert themselves into our daily lives, directly impacting how we live, how we learn, how we love, how we communicate, and drive an invisible wedge, preventing us from coming together. 
I'm not saying ZERO government, but THEY work for US. Unfortunately, we forgot that, and they are not about to remind us of that fact. So it's up to us to actually hold them accountable. If they don't want to take appropriate measures to rectify the situation ie: inflation too high, being taxed too much, interest rates though the roof, making decisions on our behalf that doesn't benifit its people. Then we fix the situation ourselves... watch this Uncle Sam. Good luck getting another tax dollar from us. We can claim tax exempt any time we want. Do you think we will pay those IRS fines? Don't hold your breath. You'll put us in prison? Let's see you find enough space on this earth that can contain all of us. Threatened military action against us?

I believe it's objectively true (fact) that trump is a felon, has a history of criminal behavior, started a sham university called Trump U, sold a condo at millions more than it's value to a known Chinese political agent while being president. Took classified documents, held them in an unsecure location and refused to give them back when asked....and it is a fact that Jeffrey Epstein called him a good friend AND Trump himself said a benefit of power is your can grab women by the $&#@ (I can go on and on, but I think this is enough to make my argument).

If any of these are factually wrong, please correct me. If they are not, how can I not consider a Trumper to be either a 1) morally compromised person AND / OR 2) ill informed in such a huge way that one would use the term Stupid.

Is there a third category?

I understand people voted for him for a lot of reasons. I am trying to stick to one point. He is an EXTREMELY low integrity felon (I think this is just a fact). So if you know that and still vote for him..... how do you justify your own integrity / values?

lz8lcyk,t3_1gl0ty4,"I love the way Americans think Trump winning only effects America. 

As an Australian, this is massive.

We are 3 years into a the worst left leadership you could imagine. Only a few days ago our Gov tried to “censor the internet” controlling what was posted and labelling and removing posts that “they saw” as misinformation. Its so toxic here right now. As a middle aged white man, I am the scourge of society. Minorities are number one. As a Christian, everything I believe in is opposed by the gov. 

Like the UK, Canada and other, if the USA sneezes, we catch the cold. The weakness of Bidens leadership has allowed the left to take over. This is not red vs blue. Libs v Dems. I feel like Americans find it hard to believe how much influence they and their leaders have on the world. Look at Britian now. Its in total free fall, they believed the left was the answer, now they have a HUGE case of buyers remorse. They see Trump and they now want this too. 
Australia is the same. We are over it.

Our election is about 3 months away (probably) and our Gov will be a one term govt. We usually give our PM a chance. Not this time. We are screaming for change. 

Canada has fallen out of love with Justin, dancing and acting so camp at a Taylor Swift concert while his cities were rioting. 

The world sees America and what is happening. 
We feel the winds shifting from the north. 
Will he be perfect. No way. Trump makes mistakes, what is evident, he wants whats best for the country he really loves and cares about. 
This is now becoming what others countries want too.

The landscape has shifted, not only for the US for the globe. Will it be a revolution or a revoult?
I think JD will keep things on track until 2032.
The left have been brutally exposed.
They need a change of policy and a rebuild of policy, this will take time. 
I pray for all Americans, no matter what you believe, Australia has a special place in our hearts for you all.

Why is there concerning rhetoric about potentially taking control of allied territories like Canada and Greenland? These are longstanding democratic partners and NATO allies. For any desired military presence or cooperation, why not pursue diplomatic channels like existing base agreements (similar to Ramstein Air Base in Germany or bases in Turkey)? How should we evaluate leadership when they express expansionist ambitions and challenge international alliances like NATO? Throughout history, forced deportations have been a tool used by authoritarian leaders - how can democratic societies prevent such policies from being implemented? What specific protections for democratic institutions would you want to see maintained and strengthened in any administration? How can we ensure continued strong partnerships with the EU and other democratic allies to prevent potential conflicts between traditional allies?

These questions aim to encourage voters to examine policies and rhetoric that could affect international alliances, consider historical patterns and their modern implications, focus on protecting democratic institutions and values, support diplomatic solutions over confrontational approaches, and maintain strong relationships with traditional democratic allies.

Our democracy relies on voters being informed and engaged in these critical discussions about preserving democratic values, protecting international partnerships, and preventing authoritarian tendencies.

m6t08y4,t3_1gl0ty4,"One of Canada's best prime ministers wrote this letter to Trump today:

Here is what Jean Cretien said today in The Globe & Mail:

Jean Chretien is 91 today and he gave himself a birthday present. He told Donald J. Trump to piss off in the The Globe and Mail. Here's his column: 

  *   *   *

Today is my 91st birthday.

It’s an opportunity to celebrate with family and friends. To look back on the life I’ve had the privilege to lead. And to reflect on how much this country we all love so much has grown and changed over the course of the nine decades I’ve been on this Earth.

This year, I’ve also decided to give myself a birthday present. I’m going to do something in this article that I don’t do very often anymore, and sound off on a big issue affecting the state of the nation and profoundly bothering me and so many other Canadians: The totally unacceptable insults and unprecedented threats to our very sovereignty from U.S. president-elect Donald Trump.

I have two very clear and simple messages.

To Donald Trump, from one old guy to another: Give your head a shake! What could make you think that Canadians would ever give up the best country in the world – and make no mistake, that is what we are – to join the United States?

I can tell you Canadians prize our independence. We love our country. We have built something here that is the envy of the world – when it comes to compassion, understanding, tolerance and finding a way for people of different backgrounds and faiths to live together in harmony.

We’ve also built a strong social safety net – especially with public health care – that we are very proud of. It’s not perfect, but it’s based on the principle that the most vulnerable among us should be protected.

This may not be the “American Way” or “the Trump Way.” But it is the reality I have witnessed and lived my whole long life.

If you think that threatening and insulting us is going to win us over, you really don’t know a thing about us. You don’t know that when it came to fighting in two world wars for freedom, we signed up – both times – years before your country did. We fought and we sacrificed well beyond our numbers.

We also had the guts to say no to your country when it tried to drag us into a completely unjustified and destabilizing war in Iraq.

We built a nation across the most rugged, challenging geography imaginable. And we did it against the odds.

We may look easy-going. Mild-mannered. But make no mistake, we have spine and toughness.

And that leads me to my second message, to all our leaders, federal and provincial, as well as those who are aspiring to lead our country: Start showing that spine and toughness. That’s what Canadians want to see – what they need to see. It’s called leadership. You need to lead. Canadians are ready to follow.

I know the spirit is there. Ever since Mr. Trump’s attacks, every political party is speaking out in favour of Canada. In fact, it is to my great satisfaction that even the Bloc Québécois is defending Canada.

But you don’t win a hockey game by only playing defence. We all know that even when we satisfy one demand, Mr. Trump will come back with another, bigger demand. That’s not diplomacy; it’s blackmail.

We need another approach – one that will break this cycle.

Mr. Trump has accomplished one thing: He has unified Canadians more than we have been ever before! All leaders across our country have united in resolve to defend Canadian interests.

When I came into office as prime minister, Canada faced a national unity crisis. The threat of Quebec separation was very real. We took action to deal with this existential threat in a manner that made Canadians, including Quebeckers, stronger, more united and even prouder of Canadian values.

Now there is another existential threat. And we once again need to reduce our vulnerability. That is the challenge for this generation of political leaders.

And you won’t accomplish it by using the same old approaches. Just like we did 30 years ago, we need a Plan B for 2025.

Yes, telling the Americans we are their best friends and closest trading partner is good. So is lobbying hard in Washington and the state capitals, pointing out that tariffs will hurt the American economy too. So are retaliatory tariffs – when you are attacked, you have to defend yourself.

But we also have to play offence. Let’s tell Mr. Trump that we too have border issues with the United States. Canada has tough gun control legislation, but illegal guns are pouring in from the U.S. We need to tell him that we expect the United States to act to reduce the number of guns crossing into Canada.

We also want to protect the Arctic. But the United States refuses to recognize the Northwest Passage, insisting that it is an international waterway, even though it flows through the Canadian Arctic as Canadian waters. We need the United States to recognize the Northwest Passage as being Canadian waters.

We also need to reduce Canada’s vulnerability in the first place. We need to be stronger. There are more trade barriers between provinces than between Canada and the United States. Let’s launch a national project to get rid of those barriers! And let’s strengthen the ties that bind this vast nation together through projects such as real national energy grid.

We also have to understand that Mr. Trump isn’t just threatening us; he’s also targeting a growing list of other countries, as well as the European Union itself, and he is just getting started. Canada should quickly convene a meeting of the leaders of Denmark, Panama, Mexico, as well as with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, to formulate a plan for fighting back these threats.

Every time that Mr. Trump opens his mouth, he creates new allies for all of us. So let’s get organized! To fight back against a big, powerful bully, you need strength in numbers.

The whole point is not to wait in dread for Donald Trump’s next blow. It’s to build a country and an international community that can withstand those blows.

Canadians know me. They know I am an optimist. That I am practical. And that I always speak my mind. I made my share of mistakes over a long career, but I never for a moment doubted the decency of my fellow Canadians – or of my political opponents.

The current and future generations of political leaders should remember they are not each other’s enemies – they are opponents. Nobody ever loved the cut-and-thrust of politics more than me, but I always understood that each of us was trying to make a positive contribution to make our community or country a better place.

That spirit is more important now than ever, as we address this new challenge. Our leaders should keep that in mind.

I am 91 today and blessed with good health. I am ready at the ramparts to help defend the independence of our country as I have done all my life.

Vive le Canada!

But there are so many people who just do not care that Trump caters to people who are. That he himself is. I get it, shit sucks right now. But we've recovered better from Covid than any other country. The economy is booming. So why aren't we feeling it? It's not because of Biden, it's because there are very few checks and balances to corporatocracies. There is blatant price gouging. Should we have fixed that? Yeah. Was it possible for Biden to do it? Maybe, maybe not. But Trump will undoubtedly make it worse. He's been transparent about it.

I don't know if this is the end of the world. But Trump is undoubtedly less stable than when he was president last. I never know what to trust out of his mouth. He's said terrible things. He doesn't mean half of them. He's said good things. He doesn't mean even a quarter of those things. I NEVER know what to expect, and I don't know how that is acceptable to the vast majority of the country, especially because Biden's mental state lost so much support for Democrats. Trump is like a blind spot to people. They're reasonable about other things, and critical, and I can't even disagree with some Trump voters' complaints about Biden and Harris. But when it comes to Trump it just does not matter what he does. It's like they don't see it at all. Biden and Harris are average politicians, and Trump is a nightmare. Does that make me excited to vote Democrat? No, but I don't want our country to be destroyed, and that's a good motivator. Will it be? I don't know. I never know what to expect. But he has Congress and the Supreme Court too. They don't have to pretend anymore, whatever it is they actually want to do, which has been hidden through several layers of lies and irony and blustering.

He won the popular vote. He's not president because Democratic voters were overconfident like in 2016. Not because of the electoral college or gerrymandering. Most real, breathing, people with 2 eyes and a brain saw 2017-2020 and said ""more please"".

I can't connect with that. I don't understand people anymore. My own community, family, friends, the smart people at work that I'm trying to learn from. The people who taught me to think for myself, the scientific method, godly values, justice, and how to see through logical fallacies & overconfidence just voted for the most stereotypical blustering through life, failing upward, lawless ""rules for thee and not for me"" man possible.",1,2024-11-06 13:21:45,Not-Clark-Kent,0,True

lvqi1xi,t3_1gl0ty4,"🇺🇸 Today, there is no “they,” only “we.” We cling to that illusion of division like it’s the last life raft, pretending we’re not all slowly sinking into the same sea of chaos. Aren’t we supposed to be Americans? Or is that just something we slap on the Fourth of July and forget about once the fireworks are over? As author and activist Arundhati Roy put it, “The war is not over; it is not even beginning; we are all in it.” (Roy, Field Notes on Democracy, 2008). It’s hard to pretend we’re separate when we’re all in the same sinking boat.

At some point, we sold our future for pocket change—sacrificing any long-term hope for the shallow comfort of a few extra dollars today. A cheaper tank of gas, a little tax break, maybe even a handful of crumbs to make us feel like we’ve won. And yet, most don’t see how deep Project 2025 and those “innocent” tariffs will cut into their lives. We’ve become a nation so wrapped up in our own smugness, we’re too distracted to notice the slow-motion disaster heading straight for us. As journalist Chris Hedges said, “We are a society that is on the edge of ruin, and the people are too distracted by the drama to notice.” (Hedges, America: The Farewell Tour, 2018). The kicker? The ones who cheered it all on are going to be the first ones to feel the sting.

If this is MAGA’s promised land, then sure—bring on those falling prices, the affordable gas, the groceries that magically cost less. But my gut tells me that’s about as likely as pigs flying. The idea that one person can “save the economy” while conveniently ignoring the rest of the world is almost adorable—like watching a toddler believe that closing their eyes means they’re invisible. As economist Joseph Stiglitz aptly noted, “Markets are global, and the idea that a single nation can somehow insulate itself from global forces is delusional.” (Stiglitz, Globalization and Its Discontents Revisited, 2017).

When the reckoning comes, at least we’ll have the privilege of saying, “we told you so.” Not that it’ll make a difference. I can already hear the chorus of MAGA voices scrambling to point the finger at everyone else, even though they’ve got the Senate, House, Supreme Court, and Presidency locked down. Watching them contort themselves to blame “the others” when they’re the only ones with their hands on the wheel will be an impressive spectacle—if it weren’t so painfully predictable. As political commentator Thomas Frank observed, “Blaming the elites is a convenient way of not facing the reality that we, as a society, are complicit in this mess.” (Frank, Listen, Liberal, 2016).

This country’s moral compass is so broken, it’s practically a modern art piece. We’re hanging on by a thread, and any hope of a miraculous comeback feels like a bad joke. Whatever storm is coming, we rolled out the welcome mat. We earned it—every dark, twisted moment of it. As historian Howard Zinn warned, “The problem is not that we are too few, but that we are too few who are willing to stand up.” (Zinn, A People’s History of the United States, 1980).  🇺🇸",1,2024-11-06 13:28:51,luckyjackass,0,True

Dumb ass Democrats clung on to abortion like idiots when the writing on the wall was clear it's the economy stupid. 

Furthermore states like FLA an MO have demonstrated they can vote for trump while supporting abortion through state level referendums. 

For example FLAs got to 58npercent of a needed 60 to overturn the abortion ban there. And Missouri literally succeeded. 

Like trump said, abortion is not the firebrand issue the Dems though

And the vote shows that white women can vote based on their pocketbokk and still support abortion bans..further trump said NO National Ban and return the issue to states to decide. As he predicted and I mention some were more liberal than we assumed 


Then as a black man I think how in our circles we talk about reparations. The say No reparations the best I can do for you is abortion.  Abortion just isn't the big issue


2. The disregard for the Palestine issue. No explanation needed

3. No plan for migrants. Spends years calling trump racist and ignore calls tomshut down border only to have Biden do it in the last half of 24. Signalling republicans were right all along. 

4.  Then I think of young men. When I went to college in 2013, all that rape culture, toxic masculinity white privilege stuff was just coming out and we found it a little weird then too. Ten years later, kids who grew up with it from their toddler years to now are over it . Manospnere people and Rogan not feeling it. Young men went trump 

5. Latinos didn't care about trump attacks on migrants. The ones who can vote are already citizens 🤷🏿‍♂️. Why would they care about people who ""skipped the line""

6.. I could go on but this election effort from Dems just seems incompetent. 

I was poised to see trump lose popular but he shellacked her. This is a clear mandate. As a Kamala voter, I support Trump's win and hope he does well to help us all do better.

It was first 9/11, the wars in the Middle East, 2008 financial crisis upon college graduation, once in a lifetime pandemic, followed by a recession with inflation powered by corporate greed. All of the events were under republican administrations and later fixed by democrats. The boomers acted like we were all too soft and didn’t want to work for anything. Even so I never blamed others for the problems, instead decided to adapt and pivot to make the best of it. I’m ashamed that then gen Z males decided the world was mean to them and voted for the strong man who promises to hand them everything. I saw some posts on another thread taking about how gen Z men have wrongly been called incels and so they felt disenfranchised. Grow the fuck up. If you don’t want to be called an incel don’t support misogyny. It’s the product that Rogan, Peterson, Tate, and the entire Republican Party sells. You want women to be nice to you then show them the respect they deserve. Women aren’t possessions they’re people and if you want one in your life then treat them as people. Trump had a myriad of problems that made him not the right choice. When I asked these younger guys why they didn’t like Kamala it was all misogynistic talking points like she laughs too much.

- Trump/Supreme Court  did not ban abortions. They left it up to the states. 

- I’m extremely curious where the lies about LGBT community is coming from. Trump has never said anything about gay marriage. He absolutely will not ban it. You know who does approve of gay marriage? Obama and Biden. Trump wants to remove boys pretending to be girls from the girls locker rooms and sports. 

- our economy went to a dumpster fire under Biden. People can’t afford homes, mortgage rates are thru the roof after Trump had them low 2s, groceries are high, gas is high. Inflation skyrocketed. 

- Biden did nothing for Covid but make it worse. Trump also didn’t do a lot of things right either. But Covid was almost out for a year before Biden took over and had no plan to do anything. They ruined the economy from shutting down and giving free money away. They hindered education for children for removing them from school. It’s ironic there were way more deaths in the states that wore mask, got the vaccine, and stayed away from people

- stock up on necessities now
- starting next year, limit how much stuff you are buying , especially from overseas
- protect yourself, be strict about protected sex. Even if you are in a monogamous relationship the risk of a life threatening complication from a miscarriage is high. 
- I would say save as much money as you can and put it into tangible things like gold? I don’t know how useful this tip will be
- be cautious about how much you give to others now, even your own parents. They are getting old and will become sick. If they lose the financial benefits from a semi socialized economy, I don’t think it’s worth it to strap yourself with a lifetime a debt. Let them reap what they sow

But clearly it was a risk America was willing to take rather than support Harris, who was the far left poster child until she decided to pick up Warhawk Nicki Haley's playbook and run it step by step all the while not being able to answer one fucking question even if it is served up by Oprah, Anderson or the most friendly media possible without devolving into a putrid word salad vomit.

15 million Joe Biden voters in 2020 stayed home or voted 3rd party rather than support this absolute imbecile who fritzed out like a robot if she had to do more than remind us she was born in a middle class family. And rather than take her loss like a person of strong character, she slinks off like a spineless thief in the night and hides behind her campaign manager, not even giving her followers the courtesy of a word and as of almost 12 hours after the race was called, she still hasn't given a concession speech.

I am ASHAMED of the Democrats who forced this slimy pathetic coward on us rather than have a real primary... her career should have been over in 2019 after her abysmal performance in the 2020 primary...  and am heartbroken to finally consider myself politically homeless.

Kamala was a joke and the far left, 20-25% of America, are a fucking albatross around the neck of real people, real issues and serious politics. Go grab your Gays for Palestine sign, wave it in front of more voters in 2026 you want to insure stay home and fuck off the Internet for once in your terminally online life.

lvrnv3w,t3_1gl0ty4,"The thing that gets me, aside from the lack of Dem voter turnout is the ignorance. People in this country are so unbelievably ignorant and stupid when it comes to what the economy is and isn't, how it moves and changes on the real time scale versus who they think is responsible and what for.

There's some solace though in knowing the people who voted for him, even if it was single-issue like the economy, don't support the rest of his policy and surrounding administration's/the GOP policies. We saw that in 2020, we saw it in 2022. The majority of Americans are opposed to 90%+ of the MAGA policy dream and Project 2025. When all that starts rolling out and getting felt, these people are going to snap awake about it, especially after they lose a wife or a daughter to lack of medical care and complications from pregnancy. Or when they are broke and homeless, or when a hurricane or other natural disaster hits and here's no early warning because NOAA is gone. The social safety net is about to get pulled up and people have no idea how much they take it for granted. 401Ks are going to lose even more value than they did under Trump 1.0. 

We have to remember that Trump and his administration also couldn't explain their way out of a wet paper bag when they inevitably caused damage or f'ed up. There's even LESS competent people in his proposed cabinet now. Same with Congress. In 2016 there were at least a majority of moderate, competent Republicans, that over the better part of this past decade, have retired or been voted out, replaced with MAGA stooges. Even over the past 8 years, we've seen the political infighting of MAGA GOP reps and senators and how even with control of both chambers, they couldn't get much done. That was with competent, experienced Republicans. Now there's only MAGA idiots left and the Dem minority, who would do well to just abstain from voting for a few years at this stage. They won't be able to enact or fulfill their dark fantasies fully or to full effect, because they're not competent enough to do so. They will cause pain, death, violence, and suffering for a lot of Americans, but overall they won't be full bore able to do everything they said or planned to do because they simply just don't have the people to do it full measure. They are comprised of con men and grifters looking to get their own personal nut rather than commit to a mission and vision as a coalition. 

I say all this to give you hope, that while yes, we will suffer hard and dearly these next four years, things will absolutely take a dark turn for the worst, people are eventually going to be touched by this election and by Trump/MAGA GOP in damaging ways that they won't forget and will change their views. Trump and company will be unable to point the finger away in a large enough convincing fashion and will be less competent to do so. Barring a Tiananmen Square attack on on Americans for being upset (which would only seal his and the GOP's fate faster and further), he and the GOP will finally get all the blame they deserve even from the far-right. 

We had two choices as a country always: the easy way and the hard way. The easy way was to vote more progressive candidates in local up to federal elections every cycle until the Overton window on policy and public sentiment shifted back leftwards. Peoples lives would improve enough that they wouldn't want to return to the previous policy stage because again, Americans really are single-issue voters after all and the economy is something that is a consistent fixture in election cycles. Instead, the electorate and those who didn't vote chose the hard way. The hard way is everything crumbling and burning down to the point where most every American save for the 1% suffers tangibly and intensely. When the system and economy are in shambles and people are getting disappeared, arrested, made homeless, or dying in completely preventable ways, people will be forced to keep their eyes and minds open that this time, this time especially, it really is the GOP's fault. 

So don't lose hope, the American people f'ed up this time, but on the whole, they choose to do the right thing and this reckoning was going to happen likely (the hard way) sooner or later because the easy way is a moonshot in today's hyperindividualistic, media illiterate, culture war, brain rot, lack of critical thinking skills society. American exceptionalism got us here, its hard and hard-felt death will be the wake up call we needed to hopefully give us the only chance we have at turning things around. People here need to realize that unless this ended up happening (the hard way, accelerationists' outcome), we were already headed for catastrophe as capitalism enters the late stages. This was inevitable and we're just ripping the band-aid off a long overdue wound we deserve. America got complacent and will have to learn, the hard way, through suffering, death, and self-inflicted injury that there is a better way and that better way is no longer a luxury, it is a must if we desire to continue as a country and as a species.",-1,2024-11-06 16:36:45,Early_Avocado_6409,0,True

lvset4j,t3_1gl0ty4,"●Some of the reasons I can think of for why a bombastic ass like Trump won re-election and lessons that the Democrats would do well to heed rather than focusing on blaming everyone but themselves (counterpoints/cautions after some of the following points, are in brackets at the end of each point):


*Hyperinflation has worsened terribly under Biden/Harris, hopefully that will now change!! 🙏

*The choice of Harris...Biden should have stepped down earlier first of all, but Harris performed terribly in the 2020 Primaries and didn't have to fight for the job in 2024. SNL appearance etc didn't help her either.


*The Biden administration (/ELITES!) denied that their even was a Border Crisis in the 1st 2 years of the Biden administration, but now they do and their is and hopefully Trump will fix it.


*People here are saying how he will now be a fascist authoritarian dictator..there are so many checks and balances in the American system that the parallels to Nazi Germany are ridiculous + I really don't think he's that type; people forget that in his first term, Trump ALSO HAD the Presidency + both Houses of Congress and the nuke codes and he didn't fulfil their fears then; it will be the same now (the only caveat is the Supreme Court now being in his pocket).


*China respects his style of leadership. Tarrifs didn't destroy the world last time round, nor did his policy on Iran.

*In his 1st administration no foreign wars were started. ISIS was effectively defeated. On the other hand, Trump created the Abraham Accords and under him there was more peace in the Middle East (can't forget Syria, or the issues that began after The Arab Spring which preceded his 1st Term).


*People forget that the ACA was a shitty compromise under Obama. Even the Mitt Romney system was far better. If Trump scraps it, it will hopefully be for something better and I doubt that pre-existing conditions will raise its' ugly head again (the only issue I have is putting that anti-vaxxer nut RFK  in control of health!)


*Finally, as a kidney transplant recipient, under the first Trump administration,  he did incredible work for kidney disease and organ donation, a massive American and a global health issue:

https://www.kidney.org/press-room/president-trump-announces-administration-s-bold-vision-transforming-kidney-care

He also created The Kidney Innovation Accelerator (KidneyX)  (a public-private partnership between the US Department of Health and Human Services  and the American Society of Nephrology).

I live in Australia, but the work they're doing will save countless lives.

Finally, for Americans, before Trumps' 1st term, people were being denied transplanted organs because the government would only pay for the 1st 2 years of immunosuppresants...without them the transplanted organ will reject and they didn't want to waste the precious limited supply because the insurance premiums were unaffordable for most Americans after year 2....under Trump this issue which has been plaguing America for decades was *finally* changed to lifelong coverage!!

For years a class of Republican intellectuals kept to dog-whistling to get rural votes, but then largely ignored them once they were in office. It was a twisted version of integrity, but for the most part there was some sensible bipartisanship behind closed doors, and major issues were resolved with a lot of political theater, but still resolved.

That system has now broken down. For years and years, Republicans told their constituents that they would remove Roe v Wade, they would stop offshoring jobs, they would put religion at the front and center of our government. And for years they never tried, because their true constituents just wanted fewer regulations and tax cuts, which made most of these truly problematic issues worse. Their frustration exploded into the Tea Party and then we got Trump.

This cancer will never go away. Rural areas that have had declining educational systems, where anyone who can leave does leave, leading to lower tax revenues, leading to worse education, is a feedback loop that is unstoppable. The Republican intellectuals who used to keep them in line have been kicked out by Trump. There are no adults in the room.

Just announcing the intent to round up immigrant workers is going to cause many of them to leave. Unemployment is at 4%. As soon as the first raids start, there will be a mass exodus of critically needed workers across multiple industries. Costs for a day of agricultural labor will go from $50 a day to $150 or $200 a day, and the replacements will be inexperienced and ineffective. Same thing for nursing homes and basically anything that requires outside labor. That alone would be enough to tank the economy, but he's going to add tariffs to the problem.

Then Trump will start gutting the other end of the labor pool. Cronyism will replace meritocracy across the entirety of the federal government. The people who have decades of experience making the machine run will be kicked out or ignored. Everyone thinks communism caused the famines in Russia and China, but nope: it was a dictator picking loyal but incredibly incompetent people to run agriculture systems.

This shows that we have major misunderstanding of who voters are. Core Democrats **did** show up but you need more than that to win elections. You need to generate votes from new and undecided voters. 1/3 of the voting population is not registered to either party.

I can tell we've learned nothing from this loss because everyone here is just focused on the blame game. They don't realize that whichever party appeals the most to the ""normal"" American will win the election. The ""State of the Union"" and ""Economy"" made up like 60% of all voters concerns this year, not any of the fringe issues. This wasn't the time to push a progressive agenda.

lvsx8eh,t1_lvqf1g2,"I just want to point out something to a lot of people that might not understand this. While this is the beginning of the next presidency, it is also the end of this storyline. The Republican Party is at a crossroads with itself and it splintering down the middle. One side you have moderate Republican who wants to move the country in a direction of conversation with Democrats and the other side you have the radical Republicans. The party is going to cannibalize itself. 

As for the people that voted for the Republican Nominee, I want to point out a little thing that you might not have thought about. While you are all for deporting migrants, we need to remember that the economy will not stay afloat without those individuals. 1) Migrants make up only 18.6% of the labor jobs in this country. That is not a number that is hurting our workforce. 2) Migrant jobs include working on farms and construction sites as well as mines, factories, food preparation, cleaning, and child care. Here is where Republicans made their mistake.

If the deportation of migrants happens, the farms, construction sites, factories, mines, food preparation companies, etc. will have few things that will occur:

1) **Getting rid the migrant workers will eventually cause these companies to close.** Why? These companies will be getting rid of their work force that is paid off the books. These companies have bult in paying migrants off the books that they would not be able to handle paying the same amount of people on the books. Result: Companies crash, farms in the Red States no longer function, prices of goods produced by the company skyrocket, people can't/won't buy their goods because they are too expensive, local economies crash, the Red States cannot function.

2)  **The companies keep the workers but have to provide them with Green Card Status.** Why? They do not want to get rid of their labor but now they have to pay them a livable wage. Result: Green Card Status increases, the migrants become citizens, which means they vote, Red States will see shifts to Blue. 

So what does that mean? Well, Republicans who felt that voting for the Republican Nominee would lower grocery costs, it won't. It will cause them to increase. Coupled with tariffs, getting rid of the CHIPS and Science Act, you're looking at being a lot worse off than you were the last four years.

So where does this go? The next four years will be an embarrassment, but Republicans will not be voted in as President for a long time after this. No one will be able to inherit the Republican Nominees cult because they have not been able to yet. The Red States population will decline because they will be moving to Blue States to feel protected. This is the end of the Republican Party.",2,2024-11-06 20:09:14,whelpthatslife,1,False

Government doesn't have that much impact on how much money people take home either. Taxes are already really low. Not making enough money falls on the employer, so it's the companies in the market.

Censorship doesn’t just restrict misinformation—it also risks silencing legitimate opinions and debate. The best approach, in my view, is transparency and encouraging critical thinking so people can make up their own minds rather than limiting the information available. Plus, a lot of what's called ""misinformation"" can sometimes just be perspectives that challenge mainstream narratives, which are crucial for a democratic society to hear, even if they're controversial.

When it comes to elections, I think the focus should be on empowering voters to access information from all sides.

ChatGPT response:
“The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, passed in 1930, was a U.S. law that significantly raised tariffs on thousands of imported goods. Officially known as the Tariff Act of 1930, it was designed to protect American industries and workers during the Great Depression by making foreign products more expensive, thus encouraging people to buy domestic goods.

However, the act is widely criticized for worsening the Depression. Many trading partners retaliated by imposing their own tariffs on U.S. goods, which led to a sharp decline in global trade. This deepened the economic crisis both in the U.S. and abroad, contributing to the global economic downturn of the 1930s.

In short, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff is often cited as a key example of protectionist policy that backfired, exacerbating the global economic slump rather than alleviating it.”",2,2024-11-06 16:53:29,linux_rich87,2,False

You aren't going to get the ignorant to vote for you with a well reasoned argument about the intricacies of democracy and esoteric arguments about rights, even if they pretend they care about rights.

Republican voters are the people who drive too fast and then get upset that someone pulled out in front of them. Or a deer jumped out. Or the road was too wet. It felt good to drive fast and that's all that matters, the accident was unavoidable because they can't make connections or refuse to lend them any weight. And they see liberals as the people telling them to slow down and put on their seatbelt.

However stupid that is, you have to accept that in order to change it. At the moment they won't change their behavior until their child dies from that accident.

We're pretty deep in the thread, but your conclusion is supported by science. Quite frankly, it's naive to expect anything more than this from the majority. Especially with both ""sides"" of the media sanewashing the Billionaire's Guy™.

It's honestly difficult to blame them. What they wanted is not what they're going to get (a better economy and better lives), but most of them wanted what everyone else wanted. They were just more easily misled into supporting a grift that is also delusion - and an added bonus of potential christofacism. They're basically damning the US to the same fate of every unwaveringly red state for essentially the very same reason; and essentially the same outcome. There are hundreds of counties across the country that have exclusively elected ravenously conservative politicians and mayors where education, income, economics, infrastructure, on and on, remain dreadful ""for some reason"".

Studies: 

Recent study has found that IQ scores and genetic markers associated with intelligence can predict political inclinations towards liberalism and lower authoritarianism | This suggests that our political beliefs could be influenced by the genetic variations that affect our intelligence.

Higher Cognitive Ability Linked to Voting Against Brexit, Study Finds.

https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/higher-cognitive-ability-linked-to-voting-against-brexit-study-finds-381321

A study has found evidence that religious people tend to be less reflective while social conservatives tend to have lower cognitive ability.

Why liberals are more intelligent than conservatives - Liberalism can be defined as the willingness to contribute large amounts of private resources for the welfare of genetically unrelated others. Research shows that more intelligent children in the US and UK are more likely to grow up to be liberals than less intelligent children. Studies show the effect of childhood intelligence on adult political ideology is twice as large as the effect of either sex or race.

As long as some other group has it worse than them, they will endure it. Unfortunately, it's going to affect us all. 

The reason his rhetoric about immigrants hits home is there has been a school of thought that the US needs to stop being the world's police. This has been around since  9/11, if not before. It is viewed as there is always money to go to war, meddle in other countries, or support other countries but not enough support for Americans. Do they realize they are asking for socialist programs and all social programs are on the chopping block? Probably not to both. Or that they will be exception to receiving aid.

Part of the reason there are so many migrants from Central and South America is because the US spent years destabilizing those countries. Think Flynn. He was running a psyop here, and people bought into it.  The people then put a strong man into power to ""fix"" the country and wound up with dictators instead. There is much more nuance to this.

That being said, as someone who studied economics and has no track record of being *publicly* proven correct, a lot of Trump’s proposals (tariffs) are not good economic proposals. His tax policy is meant to benefit the 1% instead of help restore the middle class which desperately needs it.

I don’t think America “boomed” in his first 3 years, and people like to say groceries were expensive under Biden, BUT (hopefully you won’t count that one against me) under Trump we threw out the pandemic playbook and suffered a health crisis which caused our economy to spiral worse than it had to. No doubt the global supply chain was going to get fucked no matter what, BUT it didn’t have to be such a disaster at home. We took much longer to recover from that disaster than a country of our standing should have. I recall covid groceries being absurdly expensive, and only recently have they gone back to the realm of reason.

I don’t wholly disagree with some of Trump’s positions, and internet lefties really don’t like it when you have even so much as a pinkie toe dipped in the other camp, which of course is part if why Trump won. The left pushes their own people out and doesn’t understand the word unity despite constantly preaching it. I don’t think crime is as bad as Trump makes it out to be, I think he ran on the platform of fear and it worked.

More than anything else, I think his appointment of RFK will be disastrous for public health. That moron is missing chunks of his brain and is on the record for doing things that would land any other person in an insane asylum. But being of the Kennedy lineage, he gets special treatment. He’s probably more of a danger to us than Trump. 


Again, if Trump really does pull off the greatest performance of all time, I will be happy. If he just maintains the status quo, I’ll be happy. His track record indicates that is not the reality we’re heading for though. Trump is inheriting a very strong economy. But I don’t hate him so much that I can’t acknowledge any good things he does. I’m not a democrat, I’m not a republican, I’m an American who votes for the best policy proposals. 

My turn to flip it on you. Can you accept that he might actually not be a good president if he manages to take everything he’s given and shits the bed?

And for what it’s worth. Kamala was a stupid candidate and dems are trapped in a cycle of thinking having a vagina gives you like +100 presidential stat buff. Just pick someone fucking likeable with good policy. Kamala was not likeable to most Americans. And her managing to drop 20 million votes proves she is more unlikeable than anyone ever imagined.",10,2024-11-06 15:54:22,Elprede007,2,False
lvrf9cp,t1_lvr7n1d,"As for the economy the first go round, he inherited a really good economy from Obama.    Unemployment went down under Trump but it really just continued the trend that Obama started.  Obama also beat him on job creation.  COVID wreaked havoc with the economy, we cannot fault Trump for that, but what we can fault him for was his response.  His slowness to embrace the measures, fanning of culture wars (i.e. anti-mask, etc) really made a bad economic situation much worse.  If he had just went out and said, hey, we are going to mask up, social distance, etc. to get the post-pandemic economy started earlier, we would have had a much better economy.  Instead, he went the other direction, railed against science, blamed others and generally prolonged the misery.  He also bullied the Federal Reserve into lowering the interest rates when they should have held the line or raised them, which certainly threw gasoline on inflation.  Speaking of inflation, the Biden administration inherited a fucking nightmare scenario from Trump.  High energy costs (partly caused by Trump in limiting oil production to soothe big oil donors and get oil up to $50/bbl) along with the sheer amount of federal spending and price gouging on the part of companies saddled Biden with an out of control inflation scenario.  To Biden's credit, he allowed the Fed to do it's thing without interference and was able to soft land the economy.  Which if you remember back in 2022 most people felt we were headed towards recession, and at this point the U.S. has the strongest economy in the world and bounced back from the Pandemic better than any other country.  That is almost 100% Biden's policies.  As for crime, it is at historically low levels by almost any measure.  So not sure what to tell you there.  By all means, I am for stopping unnecessary wars, Iraq and Afghanistan were both huge mistakes (except for the first 100 days of Afghanistan, when US JSOC essentially flushed out Al Qaida and sent them scurrying in all directions.  One way we do that is through projection of strength, and this is where Trump fails miserably.  As a lead NATO member nation, we spend a small portion of our GDP but reap a huge benefit from the ability to rely on other nations to assist us in projecting strength throughout the world.  People don't even realize how much the U.S. Military conducts joint operations with other countries (I can guarantee you that there are joint training exercises or missions every single day of the year in the world) and how much that helps to keep America safe at a relatively low cost.  As for Borders, Biden inherited an absolute nightmare of a Border crisis.  As much as i would like to blame all of that on Trump, alas it is more of a product of decades (even centuries) of terrible U.S. Foreign policy in Latin and South America (although Trump didn't help at all).  The Border today is as secure as it has ever been, Kamala Harris and Biden actually got many of the countries in Latin American to help us in addressing the root causes of the migration (which I will not get into here but if you would like some light reading check out ""Everyone who is gone is Here"" by J Bitzer.",6,2024-11-06 15:57:32,Silent-Law-4883,2,False

Even if you truly believe there isn't a shred of good inside of a conservative, hold onto vague platitudes like 'keep your friends close, and enemies closer' because being informed in a world where, apparently half the population is evil, is probably a good idea.

It was different from what left-leaning media said conservatives rallied behind, which was mostly major talking points (abortion, racism, sexism). I told many of my left-leaning friends that Trump was probably going to make it a close election, and they genuinely laughed at me.

lvqvezb,t1_lvqgcjo,"Because that's who he tends to go after.

7 days after taking office last time, Trump made his first of 5 attempts to ban legal green card holders from the country. 

He followed up by restricting visas and renewals for immigrants already here, and slashed refugee visas (which he's already promised to do again). 

Work visa denials rose 24% in just 2018.

Trump then attempted to block L1 visa holders (Basically foreign citizens of a US employer working in a foreign country) from getting transferred within their company.

Not to mention multiple attempts to expell all valid student visa holders from the US.

Overall non immigrant visa issuance and renewals fell over 11 million in his first term, lowest level of visa approvals since last century, 

This against a background of decreased deportations of illegals, (around 200,000-250,000 a year compared to 400,000 a year under Obama (excluding 2015)) building less border wall than any President this century, and a estimated illegal population of around 11,000,000. Which has held more or less steady since 2005.

So he doesn't actually go after Illegals, he goes after legal immigrants and lies to his followers they are illegal so they think hes tough on them.

Now add in his current campaign promise to end birthright citizenship for the children of illegals.

Democrats fault. They left it in judicial limbo on a knifes edge for 50+ years instead of pushing to codify it into law. Its not the job of the SC to be defacto law makers (Congress is), and thats what RvW acted as. Ironically, (see my last point as to why its ironic) even Ruth Bader Ginsberg didn't like the complex web of precedents that it set, she said as much back in the 70s. Dems just got a false sense of security that it was never going away, but the reality was that it was always in the hands of 6 of 9 people, and its fucking absurd when you frame it like that.

Trump just has the tax cuts. As for the Middle East, do you not know that those conflicts were initiated under republican administrations? It’s a lot easier to enter a conflict than get out of one. Biden withdrew from Afghanistan even though it was date set by Trump. Why didn’t Trump do it while he was in office? It’s because he wanted to cause chaos. I don’t always agree with the Democrats, but we had better bargaining power under them. Also Biden steadily reduced inflation since taking office. Prices remain high because of corporate greed. Maybe if you read a bit more you’d understand this. As for the stimulus in 2021 the pandemic was still ongoing and it was part of the original payment package. Just cause lockdown was over doesn’t mean people didn’t need help. You might want to take an economics class if they’re still around after Trump destroys more of the education system.

Inflation rates under Trump pretty much stayed fixed: Trump inherits Jan  2017 2.1, Jan 2018 1.9, Jan 2019 2.3, Jan 2020 2.5, 

Biden inherits Jan 2021 1.5 from TRUMP, Jan 2022 skyrockets to 7.5, Jan 2023 6.5, Jan 2024 oh it's election year let's bring it down 2.4. 

Who brought the high inflation? 


Federal tax rates were 39.7 % when Trump came into office. He passed the The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and REDUCED the top rate to 37% and adjusted other rates and brackets.

Rates were 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%, with the 37% rate starting at $500,000 for single filers in 2018, later adjusted for inflation each year.



THE BIDEN Administration kept this and called it their own and the dumbasses that don't educate themselves believed it.

2023:

Rates remained at 10% to 37%, with 37% applying over $578,125 (single) and $693,750 (joint). Adjustments to lower brackets reflected inflation changes.


2024:

The structure remains consistent with rates from 10% to 37%, but thresholds increased again due to inflation. For example, the 37% rate now applies to income over $609,350 for single filers and $731,200 for married couples filing jointly.

lvuz2au,t1_lvqkcno,"I may not be welcome here but from a European perspective Trump is going to withdraw funding to Ukraine. That's an issue, because the next biggest supplier of weapons is only 25% of what USA donates. When Trump says there will be peace, he means he will effectively hand Ukraine over to Russia, and Zelensky's head on a platter. Russia will then look to take Moldova and surrounding countries, advancing into Europe. Ukraine are plains which is effectively Russia's gateway - it's cut off to Europe and Scandinavia by mountains everywhere else. Meanwhile, Georgia recently lost a democratic election to Russian interference - the USSR is being rebuilt. Trump admitted to knowing about Putin's invasion of Ukraine. The writing is on the wall for how Trump sees Putin; ally.


Trump's sacrifice of Ukraine will also signal to Xi Jinping that it's okay for land grabs to take place, and therefore okay for China to take Taiwan without American resistance too. China also wants to dominate the South China Sea and take Southeast Asia, which I can imagine Trump is looking to pull American influence and lives out of the way. America hasn't been as damaging to China under Trump as it thinks. It's mostly rhetoric to keep an act up.


We get it - we absolutely do; the money, the American lives, the drain on American time and diplomatic relations, it's all important. But Europe doesn't think American citizens realise that, from an outside perspective, Trump is either very soft on, or that he straight up aligns closer to an axis of global evil, than he does to traditional western alliances. It feels like he's looking to split the global pot with Putin and Jinping and close America down during the carnage as the world rebalances power. That puts western alliances in a tricky spot given the role America has traditionally played over the last 100 years.

 Nazis had taken over the US government.

Of course that did not happen in WWII. Roosevelt continued in office, and helped Churchill
 win WWII. In fact, Roosevelt took the dominant part, and worked himself to death.

It looks like we in the USA are now going down the road in the book, instead of taking the
 road of the heroes in WWII. Trump has already announced that everyone who supported Harris
 is now in danger of arrest and being placed in a concentration camp. I worry for myself, my
 children, and I worry most of all for the people of Ukraine, who are now in the position of
 Poland in 1939.
